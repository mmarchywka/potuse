abstract = {The amyloid cascade hypothesis, focusing on pathological proteins aggregation, has so far failed to uncover the root cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), or to provide an effective therapy. This traditional paradigm essentially explains a mechanism involved in the development of sporadic AD rather than its cause. The failure of an overwhelming majority of clinical studies (99.6%) demonstrates that a breakthrough in therapy would be difficult if not impossible without understanding the etiology of AD. It becomes more and more apparent that the AD pathology might originate from brain infection. In this review, we discuss a potential role of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and eukaryotic parasites as triggers of AD pathology. We show evidence from the current literature that amyloid beta, traditionally viewed as pathological, actually acts as an antimicrobial peptide, protecting the brain against pathogens. However, in case of a prolonged or excessive activation of a senescent immune system, amyloid beta accumulation and aggregation becomes damaging and supports runaway neurodegenerative processes in AD. This is paralleled by the recent study by Alam and colleagues (2022) who showed that alpha-synuclein, the protein accumulating in synucleinopathies, also plays a critical physiological role in immune reactions and inflammation, showing an unforeseen link between the 2 unrelated classes of neurodegenerative disorders. The multiplication of the amyloid precursor protein gene, recently described by Lee and collegues (2018), and possible reactivation of human endogenous retroviruses by pathogens fits well into the same picture. We discuss these new findings from the viewpoint of the infection hypothesis of AD and offer suggestions for future research.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Microbial infections of the brain can lead to dementia, and for many decades microbial infections have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, a causal role for infection in AD remains contentious, and the lack of standardized detection methodologies has led to inconsistent detection/identification of microbes in AD brains. There is a need for a consensus methodology; the Alzheimer's Pathobiome Initiative aims to perform comparative molecular analyses of microbes in <jats:italic>post mortem</jats:italic> brains versus cerebrospinal fluid, blood, olfactory neuroepithelium, oral/nasopharyngeal tissue, bronchoalveolar, urinary, and gut/stool samples. Diverse extraction methodologies, polymerase chain reaction and sequencing techniques, and bioinformatic tools will be evaluated, in addition to direct microbial culture and metabolomic techniques. The goal is to provide a roadmap for detecting infectious agents in patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD. Positive findings would then prompt tailoring of antimicrobial treatments that might attenuate or remit mounting clinical deficits in a subset of patients.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The effect of L-tryptophan on root elongation of lettuce seedlings (Lactuca sativa), as well as on allelochemical activity of three species of root growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), was studied under controlled axenic conditions. L-Tryptophan exhibited an hormonelike effect, promoting root elongation of lettuce seedlings at 10minus5 and 10minus3 mM by ca. 20{\%}, but at 10 mM, root elongation was inhibited by ca. 52{\%} compared to the control (L-tryptophan-free). Comamonas acidovorans 26, Agrobacterium sp., and Alcaligenes piechaudii promoted root elongation of lettuce seedlings by 15, 30, and 44{\%}, respectively. When 10 mM L-tryptophan was applied, Agrobacterium sp. and A. piechaudii inhibited root elongation by 57.6 and 63.5{\%}, respectively. However, at the same concentration of L-tryptophan, C. acidovorans 26 promoted root growth. It is suggested that L-tryptophan reverted root growth promotion through enhancing the secretion of indole-3-acetic acid by the rhizobacteria. L-Tryptophan may have both a direct effect on root growth and an indirect effect through affecting activity of root growth-mediating bacteria. Since the growth of C. acidovorans 26 was exclusively inhibited by L-tryptophan (10 mM), it is conjectured that reduced population of this bacterium could not generate IAA at a level sufficient to inhibit root elongation. Despite the mild root growth promoting effect of C. acidovorans 26, its consistent root growth promotion, perhaps justifies further experimentation.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Probabilistic and parsimony-based arguments regarding available genetics data are used to propose that Hardy and Higgin's amyloid cascade hypothesis is valid but is commonly interpreted too narrowly to support, incorrectly, the primacy of the amyloid-upbeta peptide (Aupbeta) in driving Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Instead, increased activity of the upbetaCTF (C99) fragment of AupbetaPP is the critical pathogenic determinant altered by mutations in the APP gene. This model is consistent with the regulation of APP mRNA translation via its 5' iron responsive element. Similar arguments support that the pathological effects of familial Alzheimer's disease mutations in the genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 are not exerted directly via changes in AupbetaPP cleavage to produce different ratios of Aupbeta length. Rather, these mutations likely act through effects on presenilin holoprotein conformation and function, and possibly the formation and stability of multimers of presenilin holoprotein and/or of the upgamma-secretase complex. All fAD mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 likely find unity of pathological mechanism in their actions on endolysosomal acidification and mitochondrial function, with detrimental effects on iron homeostasis and promotion of Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]pseudo-hypoxiaUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] being of central importance. Aupbeta production is enhanced and distorted by oxidative stress and accumulates due to decreased lysosomal function. It may act as a disease-associated molecular pattern enhancing oxidative stress-driven neuroinflammation during the cognitive phase of the disease.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p><jats:bold>Background.</jats:bold> The cholinergic system is profoundly impaired in senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) and replacement therapy produces only modest clinical benefits. The serotonergic system is also impaired and may contribute both to cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms in SDAT. To investigate this further we assessed the effects of lowering brain serotonin using the technique of acute tryptophan depletion on cognitive function in patients with SDAT and in age matched control subjects.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method.</jats:bold> Sixteen patients with probable SDAT and 17 healthy elderly subjects received two amino acid drinks in a within subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, crossover design. One of the drinks was nutritionally balanced and contained tryptophan (placebo), the other was identical but contained no tryptophan. A battery of detailed neuropsychological tests was performed between 4 and 6 h after the drink. Mood rating scales and other ratings of behavioural and emotional symptoms were also performed on both occasions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold> Acute tryptophan depletion resulted in impairment on tasks of working memory in both groups. There was no group specific effect. Female SDAT subjects performed better on a task of pattern recognition during acute tryptophan depletion compared with placebo. There were no changes in behavioural symptoms during acute tryptophan depletion in either group.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion.</jats:bold> Compromised serotonergic function may be an important contributor to cognitive decline in SDAT and in ageing. Strategies targeting specific 5HT receptors may be helpful in SDAT.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is likely associated with systemic immune activation. During immune response, interferon-gamma stimu-lates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) converting tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine followed by kynurenine in an ensuing step. Thus, IDO activity is estimated by the kynurenine per tryptophan quotient (Kyn/Trp). In 21 patients suffering from AD, in 20 controls of similar age, and in 49 blood donors we measured serum tryptophan and kynurenine concentrations by HPLC. Lower tryptophan concentrations were found in elderly control subjects compared to blood donors (62.1 vs. 73.0 $\mu$M, p < 0.005). Tryptophan concentrations tended to be still lower in AD patients (54.4 $\mu$M, p = 0.07) compared to elderly controls. Enhanced tryptophan degradation in patients was reflected by significantly increased Kyn/Trp (46.1 vs. 34.1 in elderly controls, p < 0.05). Correlations were found in patients between Kyn/Trp and concentrations of soluble immune markers in serum, i.e., neopterin, interleukin-2 receptor and tumor necrosis factor receptor (all p < 0.001). Increased Kyn/Trp was associated with reduced cognitive performance. Tryptophan degradation due to immune activation may exert impact on the pathogenesis of AD.},

abstract = {Vitamin K is a fat-soluble nutrient discovered in 1935 and its role in blood coagulation has been thoroughly explored. In recent years, studies conducted in vitro and on animals highlighted vitamin K involvement in brain cells development and survival. In particular, vitamin K seems to have an antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effect mediated by the activation of Growth Arrest Specific Gene 6 and Protein S. Moreover, this vitamin is involved in sphingolipids metabolism, a class of lipids that participate in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of brain cells. An altered expression in sphingolipids profile has been related to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This review stems from a growing interest in the role of vitamin K in brain functions, especially in cognition, also in view of an expected increase of prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. It collects recent researches that show interesting, even though not definitive, evidence of a direct correlation between vitamin K levels and cognitive performance. Moreover, vitamin K antagonists, used worldwide as oral anticoagulants, according to recent studies may have a negative influence on cognitive domains such as visual memory, verbal fluency and brain volume. The aim of this review is to analyze the evidence of clinical studies carried out up to date on the relationship between vitamin K intake and cognitive performances. The involvement of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in declining cognitive performances is also addressed separately.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Pseudomonas putida</jats:italic> is a soil bacterium with a versatile and robust metabolism. When confronted with mixtures of carbon sources, it prioritizes the utilization of the preferred compounds, optimizing metabolism and growth. This response is particularly strong when growing in a complex medium such as LB. This work examines the changes occurring in <jats:italic>P. putida</jats:italic> KT2440 metabolic fluxes, while it grows exponentially in LB medium and sequentially consumes the compounds available. Integrating the uptake rates for each compound at three different moments during the exponential growth with the changes observed in the proteome, and with the metabolic fluxes predicted by the <jats:italic>i</jats:italic>JN1411 metabolic model for this strain, allowed the metabolic rearrangements that occurred to be determined. The results indicate that the bacterium changes significantly the configuration of its metabolism during the early, mid and late exponential phases of growth. Sugars served as an energy source during the early phase and later as energy and carbon source. The configuration of the tricarboxylic acids cycle varied during growth, providing no energy in the early phase, and turning to a reductive mode in the mid phase and to an oxidative mode later on. This work highlights the dynamism and flexibility of <jats:italic>P. putida</jats:italic> metabolism.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The Lascaux Cave contains a remarkable set of paintings from the Upper Palaeolithic. Shortly after discovery in 1940, the cave was modified for public viewing and, in 2001, was invaded by a Fusarium solani species complex. Benzalkonium chloride was used from 2001 to 2004 to eliminate the fungal outbreak. In this study, we carried out a sampling in most of the cave halls and galleries. Sequence analysis and isolation methods detected that the most abundant genera of bacteria were Ralstonia and Pseudomonas. We suggest that, as a result of years of benzalkonium chloride treatments, the indigenous microbial community has been replaced by microbial populations selected by biocide application.},

abstract = {<jats:p> Glutarate is an attractive dicarboxylate with various applications. Clarification of the regulatory mechanism of glutarate catabolism could help to block the glutarate catabolic pathways, thereby improving glutarate production through biotechnological routes. Glutarate is a toxic metabolite in humans, and its accumulation leads to a hereditary metabolic disorder, glutaric aciduria type I. The elucidation of the functions of CsiR and GcdR as regulators that respond to glutarate could help in the design of glutarate biosensors for the rapid detection of glutarate in patients with glutaric aciduria type I. In addition, CsiR was identified as a regulator that also regulates <jats:sc>l</jats:sc> -2-HG metabolism. The identification of CsiR as a regulator that responds to <jats:sc>l-</jats:sc> 2-HG could help in the discovery and investigation of other regulatory proteins involved in <jats:sc>l-</jats:sc> 2-HG catabolism. </jats:p>},

abstract = {A lead-resistant bacterial strain was isolated from coal mine dump and identified as Acinetobacter junii Pb1 on basis of 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) gene sequencing. The minimum inhibitory concentration of lead for the strain was 16,000\NBSPmg\NBSPlminus1 and it showed antibiotic and multi metal resistance. In aqueous culture, at an initial lead (Pb(II)) concentration of 100 and 500\NBSPmg\NBSPlminus1, lead adsorption and accumulation by the isolate was 100 and 60{\%}, at pH 7 at 30\NBSP{\textdegree}C after 48 and 120\NBSPh, respectively. The two fractions of exopolysaccharide (EPS), loosely associated EPS (laEPS) and bound EPS (bEPS), and whole cells (devoid of EPS) showed high binding affinity towards Pb(II). The binding affinity of laEPS towards Pb(II) (1071\NBSPmg\NBSPPb\NBSPgminus1) was three times higher than that of bEPS (321.5\NBSPmg\NBSPPb\NBSPgminus1) and 6.5 times higher than that of whole cells (165\NBSPmg\NBSPPb\NBSPgminus1). The binding affinity of EPS and whole cells with Pb(II), reported in the current study, is considerably higher as compared to that reported in the literature, till date. SEM analysis, showed an increase in thickness of cells on exposure to Pb(II) and TEM analysis, revealed its accumulation (interior of cell) and its adsorption (with the external cell surface). The isolate was also found to be positive for indole acetic acid (IAA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase production which helps in promoting plant growth. Thus, this study provides a new understanding towards Pb(II) uptake by A. junii Pb1, highlighting its potential on the restoration of Pb(II) contaminated repositories.},

abstract = {In this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (VB) and through cesarean section (CB) were investigated using culture-independent 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing approach. The results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of VB infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart CB infants. The intestinal microbiota of infants delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. The most abundant bacterial species present in VB infants were Acinetobacter sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Staphylococcus sp. However, CB infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. The intestinal microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of Bifidobacteria species. An interesting finding of our study was recovery of large number of Acinetobacter sp. consisting of Acinetobacter pittii (former Acinetobacter genomic species 3), Acinetobacter junii and Acinetobacter baumannii in the VB infants clone library. Among these, Acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and Acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus--Acinetobacter baumannii (ACB) complex. Although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.},

abstract = {Background: The possible relation between antibiotic exposure and the alteration of gut microbiota, which may affect dementia risk, has been revealed. However, the association between antibiotics and dementia incidence has rarely been studied. We aimed to determine the association between antibiotic exposure and the risk of dementia.Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study used data from the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) in South Korea. Exposure was the cumulative days of antibiotic prescription from 2002 to 2005. Newly diagnosed overall dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) were identified based on diagnostic codes and prescriptions for dementia-related drugs. The follow-up investigation was carried out from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013. The Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between cumulative antibiotic prescription days and dementia incidence.Results: A total of 313,161 participants were analyzed in this study. Compared to antibiotic non-users, the participants who used antibiotics for 91 or more days had an increased risk of overall dementia [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.74], AD (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.17-1.81), and VD (aHR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.83-2.30). Those who used five or more antibiotic classes had higher risks of overall dementia (aHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.66) and AD (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.00-1.78) than antibiotic non-users.Conclusion: Antibiotic exposure may increase the risk of dementia in a cumulative duration-dependent manner among adult participants. Future studies are needed to assess the causality between the long-term prescription of antibiotics and dementia risk.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Electromicrobiology is an emerging field investigating and exploiting the interaction of microorganisms with insoluble electron donors or acceptors. Some of the most recently categorized electroactive microorganisms became of interest to sustainable bioengineering practices. However, laboratories worldwide typically maintain electroactive microorganisms on soluble substrates, which often leads to a decrease or loss of the ability to effectively exchange electrons with solid electrode surfaces. In order to develop future sustainable technologies, we cannot rely solely on existing lab-isolates. Therefore, we must develop isolation strategies for environmental strains with electroactive properties superior to strains in culture collections. In this article, we provide an overview of the studies that isolated or enriched electroactive microorganisms from the environment using an anode as the sole electron acceptor (electricity-generating microorganisms) or a cathode as the sole electron donor (electricity-consuming microorganisms). Next, we recommend a selective strategy for the isolation of electroactive microorganisms. Furthermore, we provide a practical guide for setting up electrochemical reactors and highlight crucial electrochemical techniques to determine electroactivity and the mode of electron transfer in novel organisms.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>There is no cure or effective treatment for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, mainly because the etiology of these diseases remains elusive. Recent data suggest that unique changes in the gut microbial composition are associated with these ailments; however, our current understanding of the bacterial role in the pathogenesis of PCDs is hindered by the complexity of the microbial communities associated with specific microbiomes, such as the gut, oral, or vaginal microbiota. The composition of these specific microbiomes is regarded as a unique fingerprint affected by factors such as infections, diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics. All of these factors also affect the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of studies that reveal microbial contribution are correlational, and various models, including worm, fly, and mouse, are being utilized to decipher the role of individual microbes that may affect disease onset and progression. Recent evidence from across model organisms and humans shows a positive correlation between the presence of gram-negative enteropathogenic bacteria and the pathogenesis of PCDs.

abstract_as_rcvd = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>There is no cure or effective treatment for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimerâs or Parkinsonâs diseases, mainly because the etiology of these diseases remains elusive. Recent data suggest that unique changes in the gut microbial composition are associated with these ailments; however, our current understanding of the bacterial role in the pathogenesis of PCDs is hindered by the complexity of the microbial communities associated with specific microbiomes, such as the gut, oral, or vaginal microbiota. The composition of these specific microbiomes is regarded as a unique fingerprint affected by factors such as infections, diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics. All of these factors also affect the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of studies that reveal microbial contribution are correlational, and various models, including worm, fly, and mouse, are being utilized to decipher the role of individual microbes that may affect disease onset and progression. Recent evidence from across model organisms and humans shows a positive correlation between the presence of gram-negative enteropathogenic bacteria and the pathogenesis of PCDs. While these correlational studies do not provide a mechanistic explanation, they do reveal contributing bacterial species and provide an important basis for further investigation. One of the lurking concerns related to the microbial contribution to PCDs is the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance and poor antibiotic stewardship, which ultimately select for proteotoxic bacteria, especially the gram-negative species that are known for intrinsic resistance. In this review, we summarize what is known about individual microbial contribution to PCDs and the potential impact of increasing antimicrobial resistance.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Methanol has been historically considered an exogenous product that leads only to pathological changes in the human body when consumed. However, in normal, healthy individuals, methanol and its short-lived oxidized product, formaldehyde, are naturally occurring compounds whose functions and origins have received limited attention. There are several sources of human physiological methanol. Fruits, vegetables, and alcoholic beverages are likely the main sources of exogenous methanol in the healthy human body. Metabolic methanol may occur as a result of fermentation by gut bacteria and metabolic processes involving S-adenosyl methionine. Regardless of its source, low levels of methanol in the body are maintained by physiological and metabolic clearance mechanisms. Although human blood contains small amounts of methanol and formaldehyde, the content of these molecules increases sharply after receiving even methanol-free ethanol, indicating an endogenous source of the metabolic methanol present at low levels in the blood regulated by a cluster of genes. Recent studies of the pathogenesis of neurological disorders indicate metabolic formaldehyde as a putative causative agent. The detection of increased formaldehyde content in the blood of both neurological patients and the elderly indicates the important role of genetic and biochemical mechanisms of maintaining low levels of methanol and formaldehyde.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Microorganisms capable of anaerobic nitrate-dependent Fe(II) (ferrous iron) oxidation (ANDFO) contribute significantly to iron and nitrogen cycling in various environments. However, lab efforts in continuous cultivation of ANDFO strains suffer from loss of activity when ferrous iron is used as sole electron donor. Here, we used a novel strain of nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing bacterium Bacillus ferroxidians as a model and focused on the physiological activity of cells during ANDFO. It was shown that B. ferrooxidans entered a metabolically inactive state during ANDFO. B. ferrooxidans exhibited nitrate reduction coupled with Fe(II) oxidation, and the activity gradually declined and was hardly detected after 48-h incubation. Propidium monoazide (PMA) assisted 16S rRNA gene real-time PCR suggested that a large number of B. ferrooxidans cells were alive during incubation. However, <sup>2</sup>H(D)-isotope based Raman analysis indicated that the cells were metabolically inactive after 120-h of ANDFO. These inactive cells re-awakened in R2A medium and were capable of growth and reproduction, which was consistent with results in Raman analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation and x-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the formation of Fe minerals in close proximity of cells in the Fe(II)-oxidizing medium after Fe(II) oxidation. Overall, our results demonstrated that continued ANDFO can induce a metabolically inactive state in B. ferrooxidans, which was responsible for the loss of activity during ANDFO. This study provides an insight into the ANDFO process and its contribution to iron and nitrogen cycling in the environments.},

abstract = {Phosphorus is critical for the regulation of numerous metabolic processes in plants, and so understanding the mechanisms by which plants acquire phosphorus is important. Phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) are thought to promote the uptake of phosphorus by plants. The effects of PSB YJILJH and YJ101 strains on the growth of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were investigated through the production of the plant hormone IAA and the change of available phosphorus content in the soil. Two strains of YJILJH and YJ101 were selected from the rhizosphere soil of white clover among rows of apple orchards. Combined with 16S rDNA and next-generation sequencing (NGS), the strains were identified as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. The two strains had strong phosphate solubilizing ability, and had solubilization index (SI) values of 4.39 and 3.95, respectively. The dissolved amounts of soy lecithin were 351.2 and 387.3\NBSPmg/L in liquid medium, respectively. The amount of Ca3(PO4)2 dissolved reached 506.3 and 789.8\NBSPmg/L, respectively. The pot experiment showed that the biomass of white clover after adding the two strains increased by 21.17{\%} and 36.49{\%}, the total phosphorus (TP) content increased by 28.87{\%} and 30.41{\%}, and the soil available phosphorus (AP) content increased by 86.63{\%} and 47.16{\%}, respectively. This study also found that both strains can produce IAA content reaching 55.95 and 54.33\NBSPpmol / L in 72\NBSPh. In regard to relative gene expression, trpD and trpA genes were expressed in the different treatments, while ipdC was only expressed in Luria-Bertani broth (LB broth) and NBRIP media (+ soy lecithin). It is speculated that the pathway of IAA synthesis by both strains may be related to the tryptophan side chain pathway and the indole-3-pyruvate pathway. The IAA produced by the two bacteria strains is an important reason to promote the growth of white clover and participate in the process of reducing the environmental pH of the growth medium.},

Results: We found that the abundance of several bacteria taxa in AD patients was different from that in HC at the genus level, such as Anaerostipes, Mitsuokella, Prevotella, Bosea, Fusobacterium, Anaerotruncus, Clostridium, and Coprobacillus. Interestingly, the abundance of Akkermansia, an emerging probiotic, increased significantly in the AD group compared with that in the HC group. Meanwhile, the quantity of traditional probiotic Bifidobacteria of the AD group also rose. Conclusion: These alterations in fecal microbiome of the AD group indicate that patients with mild AD have unique gut microbial characteristics.

abstract = {<jats:p>The rhizosphere is a microhabitat where there is an intense chemical dialogue between plants and microorganisms. The two coexist and develop synergistic actions, which can promote plants' functions and productivity, but also their capacity to respond to stress conditions, including heavy metal (HM) contamination. If HMs are present in soils used for agriculture, there is a risk of metal uptake by edible plants with subsequent bioaccumulation in humans and animals and detrimental consequences for their health. Plant productivity can also be negatively affected. Many bacteria have defensive mechanisms for resisting heavy metals and, through various complex processes, can improve plant response to HM stress. Bacteria-plant synergic interactions in the rhizosphere, as a homeostatic ecosystem response to HM disturbance, are common in soil. However, this is hard to achieve in agroecosystems managed with traditional practices, because concentrating on maximizing crop yield does not make it possible to establish rhizosphere interactions. Improving knowledge of the complex interactions mediated by plant exudates and secondary metabolites can lead to nature-based solutions for plant health in HM contaminated soils. This paper reports the main ecotoxicological effects of HMs and the various compounds (including several secondary metabolites) produced by plant-microorganism holobionts for removing, immobilizing and containing toxic elements.</jats:p>},

Plant productivity can also be negatively affected. Many bacteria have defensive mechanisms for resisting heavy metals and, through various complex processes, can improve plant response to HM stress. Bacteria-plant synergic interactions in the rhizosphere, as a homeostatic ecosystem response to HM disturbance, are common in soil. However, this is hard to achieve in agroecosystems managed with traditional practices, because concentrating on maximizing crop yield does not make it possible to establish rhizosphere interactions. Improving knowledge of the complex interactions mediated by plant exudates and secondary metabolites can lead to nature-based solutions for plant health in HM contaminated soils. This paper reports the main ecotoxicological effects of HMs and the various compounds (including several secondary metabolites) produced by plant-microorganism holobionts for removing, immobilizing and containing toxic elements.</jats:p>},

In this paper, I demonstrated not only anticoagulant activity but also coagulant activity of sulfatide in vivo by using experimental animal models and presented the possibility that sulfatide may function contradictorily under physiological and/or pathological conditions. For instance, I presented possible involvement of sulfatide in thrombotic diseases associated with cancers.},

abstract = {We recently showed that methanol emitted by wounded plants might function as a signaling molecule for plant-to-plant and plant-to-animal communications. In mammals, methanol is considered a poison because the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts methanol into toxic formaldehyde. However, the detection of methanol in the blood and exhaled air of healthy volunteers suggests that methanol may be a chemical with specific functions rather than a metabolic waste product. Using a genome-wide analysis of the mouse brain, we demonstrated that an increase in blood methanol concentration led to a change in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes primarily involved in detoxification processes and regulation of the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases gene cluster. To test the role of ADH in the maintenance of low methanol concentration in the plasma, we used the specific ADH inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) and showed that intraperitoneal administration of 4-MP resulted in a significant increase in the plasma methanol, ethanol and formaldehyde concentrations. Removal of the intestine significantly decreased the rate of methanol addition to the plasma and suggested that the gut flora may be involved in the endogenous production of methanol. ADH in the liver was identified as the main enzyme for metabolizing methanol because an increase in the methanol and ethanol contents in the liver homogenate was observed after 4-MP administration into the portal vein. Liver mRNA quantification showed changes in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes involved in cell signalling and detoxification processes. We hypothesized that endogenous methanol acts as a regulator of homeostasis by controlling the mRNA synthesis.},

abstract = {The bacterial species Cutibacterium acnes (formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes) is tightly associated with humans. It is the dominant bacterium in sebaceous regions of the human skin, where it preferentially colonizes the pilosebaceous unit. Multiple strains of C. acnes that belong to phylogenetically distinct types can co-exist. In this review we summarize and discuss the current knowledge of C. acnes regarding bacterial properties and traits that allow host colonization and play major roles in host-bacterium interactions and also regarding the host responses that C. acnes can trigger. These responses can have beneficial or detrimental consequences for the host. In the first part of the review, we highlight and critically review disease associations of C. acnes, in particular acne vulgaris, implant-associated infections and native infections. Here, we also analyse the current evidence for a direct or indirect role of a C. acnes-related dysbiosis in disease development or progression, i.e., reduced C. acnes strain diversity and/or the predominance of a certain phylotype. In the second part of the review, we highlight historical and recent findings demonstrating beneficial aspects of colonization by C. acnes such as colonization resistance, immune system interactions, and oxidant protection, and discuss the molecular mechanisms behind these effects. This new insight led to efforts in skin microbiota manipulation, such as the use of C. acnes strains as probiotic options to treat skin disorders.},

For their application on crops, bacteria are provided in inoculant formulations that are continuously changing, with liquid- and solid-based products. Bacteria for inoculants are mainly selected from natural isolates. In nature, microorganisms that favor plants exhibit various strategies to succeed and prevail in the rhizosphere, such as biological nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization, and siderophore production. On the other hand, plants have strategies to maintain beneficial microorganisms, such as the exudation of chemoattractanst for specific microorganisms and signaling pathways that regulate plant-bacteria interactions. Transcriptomic approaches are helpful in attempting to elucidate plant-microorganism interactions. Here, we present a review of these issues.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Methanol is a natural ingredient with major occurrence in fruit spirits, such as apple, pear, plum or cherry spirits, but also in spirits made from coffee pulp. The compound is formed during fermentation and the following mash storage by enzymatic hydrolysis of naturally present pectins. Methanol is toxic above certain threshold levels and legal limits have been set in most jurisdictions. Therefore, the methanol content needs to be mitigated and its level must be controlled. This article will review the several factors that influence the methanol content including the pH value of the mash, the addition of various yeast and enzyme preparations, fermentation temperature, mash storage, and most importantly the raw material quality and hygiene. From all these mitigation possibilities, lowering the pH value and the use of cultured yeasts when mashing fruit substances is already common as best practice today. Also a controlled yeast fermentation at acidic pH facilitates not only reduced methanol formation, but ultimately also leads to quality benefits of the distillate. Special care has to be observed in the case of spirits made from coffee by-products which are prone to spoilage with very high methanol contents reported in past studies.</jats:p>},

Objective: To review appropriateness of PPI use prior to and in hospital, and deprescribing rates across different hospital units. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients geq65 years admitted to 5 acute care units: intensive care unit, acute care for elderly, orthopedics, surgery, and medicine. Patients who were Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]non-naiveUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] (prehospital PPI use) or Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]naiveUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] (new PPI initiated in hospital) users were included. For both groups, demographics, reason for admission, length of stay, comorbidities, name and number of home medications, PPI name, dose and indication, and PPI discharge instructions were collected. For naive patients, duration of in-hospital use and prescriber specialty was recorded. Results: Among non-naive patients (n = 377), for 37 patients (10%), the indication for a PPI was not appropriate, and for 92 patients (24%), the indication was unclear. Most patients had their home PPI continued while in hospital (87%) and at discharge (90%). Among naive (n = 93) patients, for 8 patients (9%), the indication for a PPI was not appropriate, and for 25 (27%) patients, the indication was unclear. PPI was prescribed to only 16 (18%) by the gastrointestinal consult service. Most patients had their new PPI continued at discharge (74%); only 7 (9%) were discharged with a plan to reassess PPI indication. Conclusion: PPIs are infrequently deprescribed during hospital admission, despite inappropriate or unclear indications for use. Thorough medication reconciliation, documentation of PPI indication and duration, and institutional focus on deprescribing are encouraged. </jats:p>},

abstract = {In the last few years, Indol-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) has been subjected to 5 pilot clinical trials in volunteers and a phase II study on patients affected by anxiety, with or without sleep problems. Overall, results indicated a very good safety profile, relief from anxiety and a better quality of sleep in patients treated with IPA. Moreover, the drug showed no withdrawal signs, but positive effects on mood, improving feelings of relaxation, calmness and happiness. The mechanism of action of IPA, depending on increased turnover of some indoles in the CNS, appears clearly distinct from that of benzodiazepines, suggesting that the drug might be used in the treatment of symptoms of mild anxiety and stress experienced by busy and anxious people.},

First, KYNA antagonizes in a non-competitive manner excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors (Perkins and Stone, 1982; Moroni et al., 1986); second, it prevents the excitotoxic actions of the related tryptophan (TRP) metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN) (Foster et al., 1984) and reduces neuronal damage after anoxic and ischemic brain insults (Germano et al., 1987); and third, it is present in mammalian biological fluids and in the central nervous system (Moroni et al., 1988b).},

abstract = {Indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) undergoes in solutions to the keto-enol tautomerism, which appears responsible of its pharmacological effects, as only the enol tautomer is an easy target for oxygen free-radicals and can be transformed directly to kynurenic acid (KYNA). Contrary to expectations, the IPA enol tautomer is rather stable in mammalian tissues, due to the presence of specific tautomerases, favouring the formation of KYNA in the presence of free-radicals. Because of the synergistic effects between glucocorticoids, free-radicals and excitatory aminoacids in chronic stress. the enol tautomer of IPA and KYNA are proposed as physiological metabolites produced in order to shut-off the chronic stress cycle.},

abstract = {<jats:p> Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), known as natural auxin, induces cleft palate in rodents. However, there has been no report about the neurodevelopmental toxicity of IAA in rats. In the present study, we found microencephaly in the fetuses from the rats exposed to IAA. The purpose of this work was to examine the effects of IAA administration in pregnant rats on neuroepithelial cells in the embryos/fetuses. IAA was administered at 500 and 1,000 mg/kg on gestation days (days) 12, 13, and 14, and then embryos/fetuses were harvested on days 14.5, 15, 16, and 21. Cleft palate was induced at 1,000 mg/kg. The brain in treated groups exhibited reduction in the size and weight on day 21 in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathologically, apoptotic cells were observed mainly in the medial and dorsal layer of the neuroepithelium at 500 and 1,000 mg/kg on day 14.5. On day 15, they were observed in the medial and dorsal layer of the neuroepithelium, and preplate at 1,000 mg/kg. On day 16, they existed in the dorsal layer of the neuroepithelium and intermediate zone in the embryos from 1 dam at 1,000 mg/kg. On day 21, an increase in cell proliferative activity was observed in the neuroepithelium at 500 and 1,000 mg/kg. The reduction of the cortical plate, the enlargement of the neuroepithelium and a slight increase in neuron density in the intermediate zone were observed at 1,000 mg/kg. These findings indicated IAA might induce the neuronal apoptosis in the S phase and lead to microencephaly. </jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The central nervous system (CNS) coordinates all our body functions. Neurons in the CNS parenchyma achieve this computational task by high speed communication via electrical and chemical signals and thus rely on a strictly regulated homeostatic environment, which does not tolerate uncontrolled entry of blood components including immune cells. The CNS thus has a unique relationship with the immune system known as CNS immune privilege. Previously ascribed to the presence of blood-brain barriers and the lack of lymphatic vessels in the CNS parenchyma prohibiting, respectively, efferent and afferent connections with the peripheral immune system, it is now appreciated that CNS immune surveillance is ensured by cellular and acellular brain barriers that limit immune cell and mediator accessibility to specific compartments at the borders of the CNS. CNS immune privilege is established by a brain barriers anatomy resembling the architecture of a medieval castle surrounded by two walls bordering a castle moat. Built for protection and defense this twowalled rampart at the outer perimeter of the CNS parenchyma allows for accommodation of different immune cell subsets and efficient monitoring of potential danger signals derived from inside or outside of the CNS parenchyma. It enables effective mounting of immune responses within the subarachnoid or perivascular spaces, while leaving the CNS parenchyma relatively undisturbed. In this study, we propose that CNS immune privilege rests on the proper function of the brain barriers, which allow for CNS immune surveillance but prohibit activation of immune responses from the CNS parenchyma unless it is directly injured.</jats:p>},

Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of Alzheimer's patients and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of Alzheimer's symptoms.To understand the involvement of Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats.We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from Alzheimer's patients decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera.Our findings reveal for the first time, that Alzheimer's symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in Alzheimer's.}},

However, a significant number of patients with an NBIA disorder confirmed by genetic testing have MRI features that are atypical for their specific disease. The appearance of specific MRI patterns depends on the stage of the disease and the patient's age at evaluation. MRI interpretation can be challenging because of heterogeneously acquired MRI datasets, individual interpreter bias, and lack of quantitative data. Therefore, optimal acquisition and interpretation of MRI data are needed to better define MRI phenotypes in NBIA disorders. The stepwise approach outlined here may help to identify NBIA disorders and delineate the natural course of MRI-identified changes.},

abstract = {Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) is an important cash crop for production of sugar and bioethanol. Red stripe caused by Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae (Aaa) is a disease that occurs in numerous sugarcane-growing regions worldwide. In this study, 17 strains of Aaa were isolated from 13 symptomatic leaf samples in China. Nine of these strains produced white-cream colonies on nutrient agar medium while the other eight produced yellow colonies. In pairwise sequence comparisons of the 16S-23S rRNA internally transcribed spacer (ITS), the 17 strains had 98.4-100% nucleotide identity among each other and 98.2-99.5% identity with the reference strain of Aaa (ATCC 19860). Three RFLP patterns based on this ITS sequence were also found among the strains of Aaa obtained in this study. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on five housekeeping genes (ugpB, pilT, lepA, trpB, and gltA) revealed that the strains of Aaa from sugarcane in China and a strain of Aaa (30179) isolated from sorghum in Brazil formed a unique evolutionary subclade. Twenty-four additional strains of Aaa from sugarcane in Argentina and from other crops worldwide were distributed in two other and separate subclades, suggesting that strains of A. avenae from sugarcane are clonal populations with local specificities. Two strains of Aaa from China (CNGX08 forming white-cream colored colonies and CNGD05 forming yellow colonies) induced severe symptoms of red stripe in sugarcane varieties LC07-150 and ZZ8 but differed based on disease incidence in two separate inoculation experiments. Infected plants also exhibited increased salicylic acid (SA) content and transcript expression of gene PR-1, indicating that the SA-mediated signal pathway is involved in the response to infection by Aaa. Consequently, red stripe of sugarcane in China is caused by genetically different strains of Aaa and at least two morphological variants. The impact of these independent variations on epidemics of red stripe remains to be investigated.},

abstract = {The amyloid cascade hypothesis has been the predominant model of molecular pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease. The finding of tau mutations in other dementias has added weight to the hypothesis as it suggests that tau-pathology is a downstream but essential part of the dementing process. However, some observations remain difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis. In transgenic mice, for example, amyloid generation does not induce the predicted cascade and in man, plaques and tangles are separated temporally and spatially. One alternative possibility is that some common factor, loss of wnt signalling for example, might induce both plaques and tangles.},

abstract = {The amyloid cascade hypothesis is widely accepted as an explanation for the neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of amyloid-beta (Abeta) as the sole cause of these changes is being questioned. Using the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, we investigated various factors contributing to neuropathology, including genetic load (heterozygous (HTZ) versus homozygous (HZ) condition), behavioural phenotype, neuropathology markers, metabolic physiology, and gut microbiota composition at early (5 months of age) and late (12 months of age) stages of disease onset, and considering both sexes. At 5 months of age, both HTZ and HZ mice exhibited hippocampal alterations associated with Abeta accumulation, leading to increased neuroinflammation and disrupted PI3K-Akt pathway. However, only HZ mice showed cognitive impairment in the Y-maze and Morris water maze tests, worsening with age. Dysregulation of both insulin and insulin secretion-regulating GIP peptide were observed at 5 months of age, disappearing later. Circulating levels of metabolic-regulating hormones, such as Ghrelin and resisting helped to differentiates HTZ mice from HZ mice. Differences between HTZ and HZ mice were also observed in gut microbiota composition, disrupted intestinal barrier proteins, and increased proinflammatory products in the intestine. These findings suggest that cognitive impairment in 5xFAD mice may not solely result from Abeta aggregation. Other factors, including altered PI3K-Akt signalling, disrupted insulin-linked metabolic pathways, and changes in gut microbiota, contribute to disease progression. Targeting Abeta deposition alone may not suffice. Understanding AD pathogenesis and its multiple contributing factors is vital for effective therapies.},

abstract = {The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bilateral communication network between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system. The essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to the normal growth and health of both animals and humans and, importantly, exerts modulatory functions at multiple levels of the GBA. Tryptophan is the sole precursor of serotonin, which is a key monoamine neurotransmitter participating in the modulation of central neurotransmission and enteric physiological function. In addition, tryptophan can be metabolized into kynurenine, tryptamine, and indole, thereby modulating neuroendocrine and intestinal immune responses. The gut microbial influence on tryptophan metabolism emerges as an important driving force in modulating tryptophan metabolism. Here, we focus on the potential role of tryptophan metabolism in the modulation of brain function by the gut microbiota. We start by outlining existing knowledge on tryptophan metabolism, including serotonin synthesis and degradation pathways of the host, and summarize recent advances in demonstrating the influence of the gut microbiota on tryptophan metabolism. The latest evidence revealing those mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates tryptophan metabolism, with subsequent effects on brain function, is reviewed. Finally, the potential modulation of intestinal tryptophan metabolism as a therapeutic option for brain and GI functional disorders is also discussed.},

abstract = {The brain-gut axis is a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Serotonin functions as a key neurotransmitter at both terminals of this network. Accumulating evidence points to a critical role for the gut microbiome in regulating normal functioning of this axis. In particular, it is becoming clear that the microbial influence on tryptophan metabolism and the serotonergic system may be an important node in such regulation. There is also substantial overlap between behaviours influenced by the gut microbiota and those which rely on intact serotonergic neurotransmission. The developing serotonergic system may be vulnerable to differential microbial colonisation patterns prior to the emergence of a stable adult-like gut microbiota. At the other extreme of life, the decreased diversity and stability of the gut microbiota may dictate serotonin-related health problems in the elderly. The mechanisms underpinning this crosstalk require further elaboration but may be related to the ability of the gut microbiota to control host tryptophan metabolism along the kynurenine pathway, thereby simultaneously reducing the fraction available for serotonin synthesis and increasing the production of neuroactive metabolites. The enzymes of this pathway are immune and stress-responsive, both systems which buttress the brain-gut axis. In addition, there are neural processes in the gastrointestinal tract which can be influenced by local alterations in serotonin concentrations with subsequent relay of signals along the scaffolding of the brain-gut axis to influence CNS neurotransmission. Therapeutic targeting of the gut microbiota might be a viable treatment strategy for serotonin-related brain-gut axis disorders.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated degeneration of the serotonin system in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuroimaging studies have extended these observations to the preclinical stages of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Serotonin degeneration has been observed also in transgenic amyloid mouse models, prior to widespread cortical distribution of amyloid-beta (Abeta). OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the regional distribution of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and of Abeta in individuals with MCI and healthy older controls, as well as the contribution of 5-HTT and Abeta to cognitive deficits. METHODS: Forty-nine MCI participants and 45 healthy older controls underwent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of 5-HTT and Abeta, structural magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessments. RESULTS: Lower cortical, striatal, and limbic 5-HTT and higher cortical Abeta was observed in MCIs relative to healthy controls. Lower 5-HTT, mainly in limbic regions, was correlated with greater deficits in auditory-verbal and visual-spatial memory and semantic, not phonemic fluency. Higher cortical A beta was associated with greater deficits in auditory-verbal and visual-spatial memory and in semantic, not phonemic fluency. When modeling the association between cognition, gray matter volumes and Abeta, inclusion of 5-HTT in limbic and in select cortical regions significantly improved model fit for auditory-verbal and visual-spatial memory and semantic, but not phonemic fluency. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the role of serotonin degeneration in the memory and semantic fluency deficits observed in MCI.},

abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in the progression of diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction. Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) encodes an lncRNA which is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether MEG3 is a potential regulator and molecular biomarker of high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction. LncRNA Meg3-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and scrambled (Scr) siRNA were transfected for MEG3 dysfunction studies. RNA and protein expression were examined by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) and Western blot, respectively. The percentage of apoptotic cells was measured by flow cytometry. Cell viability was determined through MTT assay. This study demonstrates involvement of lncRNA MEG3 in high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction. MEG3 is significantly downregulated in an endothelial cell model of hyperglycemia. In addition, MEG3 knockdown could exacerbate inflammatory damage in endothelial cells. Interestingly, MEG3 knockdown in HUVECs significantly induced proliferation and inhibited apoptosis by upregulating Bcl-2 and downregulating Bax, caspase-3, and P53. It should be noted that MEG3 knockdown could activate the TGF- signaling pathway via upregulating TGF-1, SMAD2, and SMAD7 and activate the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway via upregulating -catenin and Cyclin D1 and downregulating TCF7L2. Our results indicate that MEG3 can be regarded as a novel therapeutic target and molecular biomarker for high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas putida KT2440 has long been studied for its diverse and robust metabolisms, yet many genes and proteins imparting these growth capacities remain uncharacterized. Using pooled mutant fitness assays, we identified genes and proteins involved in the assimilation of 52 different nitrogen containing compounds. To assay amino acid biosynthesis, 19 amino acid drop-out conditions were also tested. From these 71 conditions, significant fitness phenotypes were elicited in 672 different genes including 100 transcriptional regulators and 112 transport-related proteins. We divide these conditions into 6 classes, and propose assimilatory pathways for the compounds based on this wealth of genetic data. To complement these data, we characterize the substrate range of three promiscuous aminotransferases relevant to metabolic engineering efforts in vitro. Furthermore, we examine the specificity of five transcriptional regulators, explaining some fitness data results and exploring their potential to be developed into useful synthetic biology tools. In addition, we use manifold learning to create an interactive visualization tool for interpreting our BarSeq data, which will improve the accessibility and utility of this work to other researchers.IMPORTANCE Understanding the genetic basis of P. putidas diverse metabolism is imperative for us to reach its full potential as a host for metabolic engineering. Many target molecules of the bioeconomy and their precursors contain nitrogen. This study provides functional evidence linking hundreds of genes to their roles in the metabolism of nitrogenous compounds, and provides an interactive tool for visualizing these data. We further characterize several aminotransferases, lactamases, and regulators, which are of particular interest for metabolic engineering.},

abstract = {Soil microorganisms mineralize lignin-derived aromatic carbon sources using oxidative catabolic pathways, such as the -ketoadipate pathway. Although this aromatic pathway is one of the best-studied pathways in biochemistry, the complete pathway, including its regulation by aromatic carbon sources, has not been integrated into the metabolic network. In particular, information about the in vivo operation (e.g., kinetics and flux capacity) of the pathway is lacking. In this contribution, we use kinetic modeling and thermodynamic analysis to evaluate the in vivo operation of this key aromatic multi-step pathway. The resulting ab initio deterministic model of benzoate degradation via the -ketoadipate (ortho-cleavage) pathway in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is presented. The kinetic model includes mechanistic rate expressions for the enzymes and transport processes. The design and experimental validation of the model are driven by data generated from short-term perturbation experiments in a benzoate-limited continuous culture. The results of rigorous modeling of the in vivo dynamics provide strong support for flux regulation by the benzoate transporter and the enzymes forming and cleaving catechol. Revisiting the -ketoadipate pathway might be valuable for applications in different fields, such as biochemistry and metabolic engineering, that use lignin monomers as a carbon source.},

abstract = {Genetic differentiation by natural selection is readily observed among microbial populations, but a more comprehensive understanding of evolutionary forces, genetic causes, and resulting phenotypic advantages is not often sought. Recently, a surface population of Pseudomonas putida bacteria was shown to evolve rapidly by natural selection of better-adapted variants in a mixed-species biofilm consortium (S. K. Hansen, P. B. Rainey, J. A. Haagensen, and S. Molin, Nature 445:533-536, 2007). Adaptation was caused by mutations in a wapH homolog (PP4943) involved in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. Here we investigate further the biofilm physiology and the phenotypic characteristics of the selected P. putida rough colony variants. The coexistence of the P. putida population in a mixed-species biofilm with Acinetobacter sp. strain C6 is dependent on the benzoate excreted from Acinetobacter during the catabolism of benzyl alcohol, the sole carbon source. Examination of biofilm development and the dynamics of the wild-type consortium revealed that the biofilm environment became oxygen limited, possibly with low oxygen concentrations around Acinetobacter microcolonies. In contrast to P. putida wild-type cells, which readily dispersed from the mixed-species biofilm in response to oxygen starvation, the rough variant cells displayed a nondispersal phenotype. However, in monospecies biofilms proliferating on benzoate, the rough variant (like the wild-type population) dispersed in response to oxygen starvation. A key factor explaining this conditional, nondispersal phenotype is likely to be the acquired ability of the rough variant to coaggregate specifically with Acinetobacter cells. We further show that the P. putida rough variant displayed enhanced production of a cellulose-like polymer as a consequence of the mutation in wapH. The resulting phenotypic characteristics of the P. putida rough variant explain its enhanced fitness and ability to form tight structural associations with Acinetobacter microcolonies.},

abstract = {The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other taupathies include neurofibrillary tangles and plaques. Despite the fact that only 2-10% of AD cases are associated with genetic mutations, no nontransgenic or metabolic models have been generated to date. The findings of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) in plaques of the AD brain were reported recently by the authors. Here it is shown that expression of cytoplasmic-TrpRS is inversely correlated with neurofibrillary degeneration, whereas a nonionic detergent-insoluble presumably aggregated TrpRS is simultaneously accumulated in human cells treated by tryptamine, a metabolic tryptophan analog that acts as a competitive inhibitor of TrpRS. TrpRSN- terminal peptide self-assembles in double-helical fibrils in vitro. Herein, tryptamine causes neuropathy characterized by motor and behavioral deficits, hippocampal neuronal loss, neurofibrillary tangles, amyloidosis, and glucose decrease in mice. Tryptamine induced the formation of helical fibrillary tangles in both hippocampal neurons and glia. Taken together with the authors' previous findings of tryptamine-induced nephrotoxicity and filamentous tangle formation in kidney cells, the authors' data indicates a general role of tryptamine in cell degeneration and loss. It is concluded that tryptamine as a component of a normal diet can induce neurodegeneration at the concentrations, which might be consumed along with food. Tryptophan-dependent tRNAtrp aminoacylation catalyzed by TrpRS can be inhibited by its substrate tryptophan at physiological concentrations was demonstrated. These findings indicate that the dietary supplementation with tryptophan as a tryptamine competitor may not counteract the deleterious influence of tryptamine. The pivotal role of TrpRS in protecting against neurodegeneration is suggested, providing an insight into the pathogenesis and a possible treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.},

abstract = {Comamonas spp. are non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. They were first discovered in 1894, and since then, twenty-four species have been characterized. The natural habitat of these bacteria is soil, wastewater/sludge, fresh water such as ponds and rivers, and the animal intestinal microbiome. They were also isolated from industrial settings, such as activated sludge and polluted soil, and from the hospital environment and clinical samples, such as urine, pus, blood, feces, and kidney. Comamonas spp. are associated with environmental bioremediation and are considered an important environmental bacterium rather than a human pathogen. However, in the 1980s, they became a concern when several human infections associated with these species were reported. Here, the Comamonas genus was examined in terms of its members, identification techniques, and pathogenicity. Seventy-seven infection cases associated with these microorganisms that have been discussed in the literature were identified and investigated in this project. All relevant information regarding year of infection, country of origin, patient information such as age, sex, underlying medical conditions if any, type of infection caused by the Comamonas species, antibiotic susceptibility testing, treatment, and outcomes for the patient were extracted from case reports. The findings suggest that even though Comamonas spp. are thought of as being of low virulence, they have caused harmful health conditions in many healthy individuals and even death in patients with underlying conditions. Antimicrobial treatment of infections associated with these species, in general, was not very difficult; however, it can become an issue in the future because some strains are already resistant to different classes of antibiotics. Therefore, these pathogens should be considered of such importance that they should be included in the hospital screening programs.},

abstract = {Beta-proteobacteria belonging to the genus Acidovorax have been described from various environments. Many strains can interact with a range of hosts, including humans and plants, forming neutral, beneficial or detrimental associations. In the frame of this study, we investigated the genomic properties of 52 bacterial strains of the genus Acidovorax, isolated from healthy roots of Lotus japonicus, with the intent of identifying traits important for effective plant-growth promotion. Based on single-strain inoculation bioassays with L. japonicus, performed in a gnotobiotic system, we distinguished seven robust plant-growth promoting strains from strains with no significant effects on plant-growth. We showed that the genomes of the two groups differed prominently in protein families linked to sensing and transport of organic acids, production of phytohormones, as well as resistance and production of compounds with antimicrobial properties. In a second step, we compared the genomes of the tested isolates with those of plant pathogens and free-living strains of the genus Acidovorax sourced from public repositories. Our pan-genomics comparison revealed features correlated with commensal and pathogenic lifestyle. We showed that commensals and pathogens differ mostly in their ability to use plant-derived lipids and in the type of secretion-systems being present. Most free-living Acidovorax strains did not harbour any secretion-systems. Overall, our data indicate that Acidovorax strains undergo extensive adaptations to their particular lifestyle by horizontal uptake of novel genetic information and loss of unnecessary genes.},

abstract = {Aims: Excessive methylation may be a precipitating factor for Parkinsons disease (PD) since S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the endogenous methyl donor, induces PD-like changes when injected into the rat brain. The hydrolysis of the methyl ester bond of the methylated proteins produces methanol. Since methanol is oxidized into formaldehyde, and formaldehyde into formic acid in the body, we investigated the effects of SAM on the production of methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid in rat brain striatal homogenates and the toxicity of these products in PC12 cells. Main methods: radio-enzymatic and colorimetric assays, cell viability, Western blot. Key findings: SAM increased the formation of methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Concentrations of [3H-methyl]-SAM at 0.17, 0.33, 0.67 and 1.34 nM produced 3.8, 8.0, 18.3 and 34.4 fmol/mg protein/h of [3H] methanol in rat striatal homogenates, respectively. SAM also significantly generated formaldehyde and formic acid in striatal homogenates. Formaldehyde was the most toxic metabolite to differentiated PC12 pheochromocytoma cells in cell culture studies, indicating that formaldehyde formed endogenously may contribute to neuronal damage in excessive methylation conditions. Subtoxic concentration of formaldehyde decreased the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, the limiting factor in dopamine synthesis. Formaldehyde was more toxic to catecholaminergic PC12 cells than C6 glioma cells, indicating that neurons are more vulnerable to formaldehyde than glia cells. Significance: We suggest that excessive carboxylmethylation of proteins might be involved in the SAM-induced PD-like changes and in the aging process via the toxic effects of formaldehyde.},

abstract = {This study explores the potential of lead resistant bacterium Acinetobacter junii Pb1 for adsorption/accumulation of lead using various techniques. In the present work, growth of A. junii Pb1 was investigated in the presence of a range of Pb(II) concentrations (0, 100, 250, 500, and 1000mgl1). Lead was found to have no toxic effect on the growth of A. junii Pb1 at 100 and 250mgl1 concentrations. However, further increase in Pb(II) concentration (500mgl1) showed increase in lag phase, though growth remained unaffected and significant growth inhibition was observed when concentration was increased to 1000mgl1. Same was confirmed by the observations of flow cytometry. Further, the effect of Pb(II) on A. junii Pb1 was evaluated by using fluorescence microscopy, spectrofluorimetry, and flow cytometry. The spectrofluorimetry and fluorescence microscopy results revealed the accumulation of Pb(II) inside the bacterial cells as evident by green fluorescence due to lead binding fluorescent probe, Leadmium Green AM dye. Flow cytometry observations indicate an increase in cell size and granularity of exposure to lead. Thus, present work provides a new understanding of Pb(II) tolerance in A. junii Pb1 and its potential use in remediation of lead from contaminated soil.},

abstract = {Tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells are responsible for local immune surveillance in different tissues, including the brain. They constitute the first line of defense against pathogens and cancer cells and play a role in autoimmunity. A recently published study demonstrated that CD8 T cells with markers of residency containing distinct granzymes and interferon-gamma infiltrate the parenchyma of the substantia nigra and contact dopaminergic neurons in an early premotor stage of Parkinson's disease. This infiltration precedes alpha-synuclein aggregation and neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, suggesting a relevant role for CD8 T cells in the onset of the disease. To date, the nature of the antigen that initiates the adaptive immune response remains unknown. This review will discuss the role of tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells in brain immune homeostasis and in the onset of Parkinson's disease and other neurological diseases. We also discuss how aging and genetic factors can affect the CD8 T cell immune response and how animal models can be misleading when studying human-related immune response. Finally, we speculate about a possible infectious or autoimmune origin of Parkinson's disease.},

Memantine, low-affinity NMDAR channel blocker, has been used in the treatment of moderate to severe AD. However, clear evidence is still deficient in demonstrating the underlying mechanisms and a relationship between NMDARs dysfunction and AD.

abstract = {Following previous observations a statistically significant association between various types of spirochetes and Alzheimers disease (AD) fulfilled Hills criteria in favor of a causal relationship. If spirochetal infections can indeed cause AD, the pathological and biological hallmarks of AD should also occur in syphilitic dementia. To answer this question, observations and illustrations on the detection of spirochetes in the atrophic form of general paresis, which is known to be associated with slowly progressive dementia, were reviewed and compared with the characteristic pathology of AD. Historic observations and illustrations published in the first half of the 20th Century indeed confirm that the pathological hallmarks, which define AD, are also present in syphilitic dementia. Cortical spirochetal colonies are made up by innumerable tightly spiraled Treponema pallidum spirochetes, which are morphologically indistinguishable from senile plaques, using conventional light microscopy. Local brain amyloidosis also occurs in general paresis and, as in AD, corresponds to amyloid beta. These historic observations enable us to conclude that chronic spirochetal infections can cause dementia and reproduce the defining hallmarks of AD. They represent further evidence in support a causal relationship between various spirochetal infections and AD. They also indicate that local invasion of the brain by these helically shaped bacteria reproduce the filamentous pathology characteristic of AD. Chronic infection by spirochetes, and co-infection with other bacteria and viruses should be included in our current view on the etiology of AD. Prompt action is needed as AD might be prevented.},

abstract = {The established role of vitamin K in nutrition is as a cofactor in the post-translational conversion of specific glutamyl to gamma-carboxyglutamyl (Gla) residues in a limited number of proteins. Administration of the vitamin K antagonist warfarin has previously been shown to decrease brain sulfatide concentrations and decrease brain galactocerebroside sulfotransferase (GST) activity in young mice. A dietary deficiency of vitamin K has now been shown to decrease (P < 0.01) brain sulfatide concentrations of 30-d-old mice significantly (by 21%). Male 21-d-old rats fed an excess of vitamin K for 7 or 14 d had 26 and 31% (P < 0.05) greater GST activity and 15 and 18% (P < 0.05) greater brain sulfatide concentrations, respectively, than controls fed a vitamin K-deficient diet. Male 21-d-old rats fed a diet containing 500 mg of phylloquinone/kg diet had an intermediate response and were vitamin K sufficient by normal criteria. The vitamin K response was observed when either phylloquinone or menaquinone-4 was fed as a source of the vitamin. These data suggest that in addition to its recognized role in Gla synthesis, vitamin K status is important in the maintenance of normal complex lipid sulfatide metabolism in young rats and mice.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating neurological disease, which is characterized by multifocal demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system. The most abundant myelin lipids are galactosylceramides and their sulfated form, sulfatides, which together account for about 27% of the total dry weight of myelin. In this study we investigated the role of vitamin K in remyelination, by using an animal model for MS, the cuprizone model. Demyelination was induced in C57Bl6/J mice, by feeding them a special diet containing 0.3% cuprizone (w/w) for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, cuprizone was removed from the diet and mice were allowed to remyelinate for either 1 or 3 weeks, in the absence or presence of vitamin K (i.p. phylloquinone, 2mg, three times per week). Vitamin K enhanced the production of total brain sulfatides, after both 1 week and 3 weeks of remyelination (n = 5, P-values were <0.0001), when compared with the control group. To determine whether or not there is a synergistic effect between vitamins K and D for the production of brain sulfatides, we employed a similar experiment as above. Vitamin K also increased the production of individual brain sulfatides, including d18:1/18:0, d18:1/20:0, d18:1/24:0, and d18:1/24:1 after 3 weeks of remyelination, when compared to the control group. In addition, vitamin D enhanced the production of total brain sulfatides, as well as d18:1/18:0, d18:1/24:0, and d18:1/24:1 sulfatides after 3 weeks of remyelination, but no synergistic effect between vitamins K and D for the production of total brain sulfatides was observed.},

Materials and Methods:: The study recruited 100 patients with AD who were diagnosed at the memory clinic in Seoul Medical Center in 2014. For each patient, baseline characteristics, neuropsychological tests, cerebrovascular risk factors, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTLA), and severity of small vessel disease (SVD) according to the existence of MBs were evaluated. Results:: The prevalence of MBs in patients with AD was 33%. The percentage of male gender, the severity of SVD and MTLA were significantly increased in MB(+) group. The MB(+) group showed more severe MTLA and SVD than MB() group. Conclusions:: These results suggested that MBs might reflect the burden of amyloid and ischemic vascular pathology.},

abstract = {Methanol has been historically considered an exogenous product that leads only to pathological changes in the human body when consumed. However, in normal, healthy individuals, methanol and its short-lived oxidized product, formaldehyde, are naturally occurring compounds whose functions and origins have received limited attention. There are several sources of human physiological methanol. Fruits, vegetables, and alcoholic beverages are likely the main sources of exogenous methanol in the healthy human body. Metabolic methanol may occur as a result of fermentation by gut bacteria and metabolic processes involving S-adenosyl methionine. Regardless of its source, low levels of methanol in the body are maintained by physiological and metabolic clearance mechanisms. Although human blood contains small amounts of methanol and formaldehyde, the content of these molecules increases sharply after receiving even methanol-free ethanol, indicating an endogenous source of the metabolic methanol present at low levels in the blood regulated by a cluster of genes. Recent studies of the pathogenesis of neurological disorders indicate metabolic formaldehyde as a putative causative agent. The detection of increased formaldehyde content in the blood of both neurological patients and the elderly indicates the important role of genetic and biochemical mechanisms of maintaining low levels of methanol and formaldehyde.},

abstract = {Lactate has been considered for a long time as a metabolic waste and/or a sign of hypoxia in the central nervous system. Nevertheless, clear evidence that lactate can constitute an adequate energy substrate for brain tissue has been provided as early as in the 1950s with the pioneering work of McIlwain in brain slices. Over the years, several studies using different approaches have confirmed that lactate is efficiently oxidized by brain cells in vitro. Moreover, lactate has been shown under certain circumstances to have a neuroprotective effect and support neuronal activity. Similar confirmation of lactate utilization in vivo as well as putative neuroprotection in various excitotoxic models has been provided. Lactate was even shown to restore cognitive performance upon an hypoglycemic episode in humans. More recently, it was proposed that lactate could be produced by astrocytes and released in the extracellular space to form a pool readily available for neurons in case of high energy demands. Several elements support the concept of a lactate shuttle between astrocytes and neurons in the central nervous system. Among them, the description of specific monocarboxylate transporters found on both astrocytes and neurons is an important observation consistent with this concept. Interestingly, lactate shuttles between different cell types within the same organ have been described outside the central nervous system, notably in muscle and testis. Thus, lactate is emerging as a valuable intercellular exchange molecule in different systems including the brain where it might be an essential element of neuron-glia metabolic interactions.},

abstract = {Microbial nitrate-dependent, Fe(II) oxidation (NDFO) is a ubiquitous biogeochemical process in anoxic sediments. Since most microorganisms that can oxidize Fe(II) with nitrate require an additional organic substrate for growth or sustained Fe(II) oxidation, the energetic benefits of NDFO are unclear. The process may also be self-limiting in batch cultures due to formation of Fe-oxide cell encrustations. We hypothesized that NDFO provides energetic benefits via a mixotrophic physiology in environments where cells encounter very low substrate concentrations, thereby minimizing cell encrustations. Acidovorax sp. strain 2AN was incubated in anoxic batch reactors in a defined medium containing 5 to 6 mM NO3, 8 to 9 mM Fe2+, and 1.5 mM acetate. Almost 90% of the Fe(II) was oxidized within 7 days with concomitant reduction of nitrate and complete consumption of acetate. Batch-grown cells became heavily encrusted with Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, lost motility, and formed aggregates. Encrusted cells could neither oxidize more Fe(II) nor utilize further acetate additions. In similar experiments with chelated iron (Fe(II)-EDTA), encrusted cells were not produced, and further additions of acetate and Fe(II)-EDTA could be oxidized. Experiments using a novel, continuous-flow culture system with low concentrations of substrate, e.g., 100 M NO3, 20 M acetate, and 50 to 250 M Fe2+, showed that the growth yield of Acidovorax sp. strain 2AN was always greater in the presence of Fe(II) than in its absence, and electron microscopy showed that encrustation was minimized. Our results provide evidence that, under environmentally relevant concentrations of substrates, NDFO can enhance growth without the formation of growth-limiting cell encrustations.},

abstract = {Herbaspirillum sp. WT00C is a tea-plant-specific endophytic bacterium. A genomic survey revealed an intact pathway for selenocompound metabolism in the genome of this bacterium. When it was cultured with sodium selenate, Herbaspirillum sp. WT00C was able to turn the culture medium to red. Electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed that Herbaspirillum sp. WT00C reduced selenite (Se6+) to elemental selenium (Se0), and selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) were secreted outside bacterial cells and grew increasingly larger to form Se-nanospheres and finally crystallized to form selenoflowers. Biochemical assays showed that selenospheres contained proteins but not carbohydrates or lipids. The improvement of selenium enrichment of tea plants by Herbaspirillum sp. WT00C was also tested. After Herbaspirillum sp. WT00C was inoculated into tea seedlings via needle injection and soaking tea-cutting methods, this endophytic bacterium markedly enhanced selenium enrichment of tea. When the tea seedlings inoculated by soaking tea-cutting mode were cultivated in the selenium-containing soils, selenium contents of tea leaves in three experimental groups were more than twofold compared to those of control groups. Our study demonstrates that the endophytic bacterium Herbaspirillum sp. WT00C has the ability to reduce selenate and improve selenium enrichment of tea.},

abstract = {Microbial arsenic methylation by arsenite (As(III)) S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferases (ArsMs) can produce the intermediate methylarsenite (MAs(III)), which is highly toxic and is used by some microbes as an antibiotic. Other microbes have evolved mechanisms to detoxify MAs(III). In this study, an arsRM operon was identified in the genome of an MAs(III)-methylation strain Noviherbaspirillum denitrificans HC18. The arsM gene (NdarsM) is located downstream of an open reading frame encoding an MAs(III)-responsive transcriptional regulator (NdArsR). The N. denitrificans arsRM genes are co-transcribed whose expression is significantly induced by MAs(III), likely by alleviating the repressive effect of ArsR on arsRM transcription. Both in vivo and in vitro assays showed that NdArsM methylates MAs(III) to dimethyl- and trimethyl-arsenicals but does not methylate As(III). Heterologous expression of NdarsM in arsenic-sensitive Escherichia coli AW3110 conferred resistance to MAs(III) but not As(III). NdArsM has the four conserved cysteine residues present in most ArsMs, but only two of them are essential for MAs(III) methylation. The ability to methylate MAs(III) by enzymes such as NdArsM may be an evolutionary step originated from enzymes capable of methylating As(III). This finding reveals a mechanism employed by microbes such as N. denitrificans HC18 to detoxify MAs(III) by further methylation.},

abstract = {An aerobic denitrifier was newly isolated from soil and its denitrification activity under different C/N (carbon/nitrogen) ratios was investigated. The isolate was identified as Pseudomonas putida AD-21 by biochemical studies and 16s rDNA sequencing analysis. P. putida AD-21 tolerated oxygen levels of 5.0-6.0 mg/l. An (15)NH(4)/(14)NO(3) analysis indicated that the nitrogen of NH(4) was preferentially assimilated into the cell mass and that the nitrate removed could be considered an indication of bacterial denitrification efficiency. Increasing the C/N ratio increased the nitrate removal rates, whereas nitrogen assimilation into the cell mass was not affected. The optimal C/N ratio was 8 with a maximum nitrate removal rate of 254.6 mg/l/h and a nitrate removal efficiency of 95.9%. The results suggest that P. putida AD-21 may be a good candidate for aerobic wastewater treatment.},

abstract = {Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on three isolates of an unknown Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped organism isolated from raw sewage. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that these strains were members of the Bergeyella-Chryseobacterium-Riemerella branch of the family Flavobacteriaceae. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from reference strains by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and biochemical tests. The organism contained menaquinone MK-6 as the predominant respiratory quinone and had a DNA G+C content of 31 mol%. A most probable number-PCR approach was developed to detect, and estimate the numbers of, this organism. Untreated wastewater from one plant yielded an estimated count of 1.4 x 10(5) cells ml(-1), and untreated wastewater from a second plant yielded an estimated count of 1.4 x 10(4) cells ml(-1). Signal was not detected from treated effluent or from human stool specimens. On the basis of the results of the study presented, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified in a novel genus Cloacibacterium, as Cloacibacterium normanense gen. nov., sp. nov., which is also the type species. The type strain of Cloacibacterium normanense is strain NRS1(T) (=CCUG 46293(T) = CIP 108613(T) = ATCC BAA-825(T) = DSM 15886(T)).},

abstract = {Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a small colorless amine oxide generated from choline, betaine, and carnitine by gut microbial metabolism. It accumulates in the tissue of marine animals in high concentrations and protects against the protein-destabilizing effects of urea. Plasma level of TMAO is determined by a number of factors including diet, gut microbial flora and liver flavin monooxygenase activity. In humans, a positive correlation between elevated plasma levels of TMAO and an increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events and death is reported. The atherogenic effect of TMAO is attributed to alterations in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, activation of inflammatory pathways and promotion foam cell formation. TMAO levels increase with decreasing levels of kidney function and is associated with mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. A number of therapeutic strategies are being explored to reduce TMAO levels, including use of oral broad spectrum antibiotics, promoting the growth of bacteria that utilize TMAO as substrate and the development of target-specific molecules with varying level of success. Despite the accumulating evidence, it is questioned whether TMAO is the mediator of a bystander in the disease process. Thus, it is important to undertake studies examining the cellular signaling in physiology and pathological states in order to establish the role of TMAO in health and disease in humans.},

abstract = {Plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere are the determinants of plant health, productivity and soil fertility. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are bacteria that can enhance plant growth and protect plants from disease and abiotic stresses through a wide variety of mechanisms; those that establish close associations with plants, such as the endophytes, could be more successful in plant growth promotion. Several important bacterial characteristics, such as biological nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, ACC deaminase activity, and production of siderophores and phytohormones, can be assessed as plant growth promotion (PGP) traits. Bacterial inoculants can contribute to increase agronomic efficiency by reducing production costs and environmental pollution, once the use of chemical fertilizers can be reduced or eliminated if the inoculants are efficient. For bacterial inoculants to obtain success in improving plant growth and productivity, several processes involved can influence the efficiency of inoculation, as for example the exudation by plant roots, the bacterial colonization in the roots, and soil health. This review presents an overview of the importance of soil-plant-microbe interactions to the development of efficient inoculants, once PGPB are extensively studied microorganisms, representing a very diverse group of easily accessible beneficial bacteria.},

abstract = {Although methanol toxicity is well known for acute neurological sequelae leading to blindness or death, there is a new impetus to investigate the chronic effects of methanol exposure. These include a recently established link between formaldehyde, a methanol metabolite, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In the present study, mice were fed with methanol to revisit the chronic effects of methanol toxicity, especially as it pertains to AD progression. Three groups of mice (n = 9) were given either water as a control or a methanol solution (concentrations of 2% or 3.8%) over a 6-week period. The methanol-fed mice were found to have impaired spatial recognition and olfactory memory in Y-maze and olfactory memory paradigms. Immunohistochemical analysis of the mouse brains found increased neuronal tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus and an increased cellular apoptotic marker in hippocampal CA1 neurons (~10% of neurons displayed chromatin condensation) in the methanol-fed groups. Two additional in vitro experiments in mouse embryonic cerebral cortex neurons and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells found that formaldehyde, but not methanol or the methanol end product formic acid, induced microtubule disintegration and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. The findings of the behavioral tests and immunohistochemical analysis suggested that the methanol-fed mice presented with partial AD-like symptoms. The in vitro experiments suggested that formaldehyde was most likely the detrimental component of methanol toxicity related to hippocampal tau phosphorylation and the subsequent impaired memory in the mice. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that links formaldehyde to AD pathology.},

abstract = {A recently established link between formaldehyde, a methanol metabolite, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology has provided a new impetus to investigate the chronic effects of methanol exposure. This paper expands this investigation to the non-human primate, rhesus macaque, through the chronic feeding of young male monkeys with 3% methanol ad libitum. Variable Spatial Delay Response Tasks of the monkeys found that the methanol feeding led to persistent memory decline in the monkeys that lasted 6 months beyond the feeding regimen. This change coincided with increases in tau protein phosphorylation at residues T181 and S396 in cerebrospinal fluid during feeding as well as with increases in tau phosphorylated aggregates and amyloid plaques in four brain regions postmortem: the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and the hippocampus. Tau phosphorylation in cerebrospinal fluid was found to be dependent on methanol feeding status, but phosphorylation changes in the brain were found to be persistent 6 months after the methanol feeding stopped. This suggested the methanol feeding caused long-lasting and persistent pathological changes that were related to AD development in the monkey. Most notably, the presence of amyloid plaque formations in the monkeys highlighted a marked difference in animal systems used in AD investigations, suggesting that the innate defenses in mice against methanol toxicity may have limited previous investigations into AD pathology. Nonetheless, these findings support a growing body of evidence that links methanol and its metabolite formaldehyde to AD pathology.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen often associated with chronic infections in the lungs of individuals with the heritable disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that aromatic amino acids within CF lung secretions (sputum) not only serve as carbon and energy sources but also enhance synthesis of the cell signaling molecule Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS). The present study investigates the role of the aromatic amino acid-responsive regulator PhhR in mediating these phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PhhR controls four putative transcriptional units (phhA, hpd, hmgA, and dhcA) involved in aromatic amino acid catabolism; however, genes involved in PQS biosynthesis were unaffected. The phhA, hpd, hmgA, and dhcA promoters were mapped by primer extension, and purified His6-PhhR was shown to bind the phhA, hpd, and dhcA promoters in vitro by use of electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Our work characterizes a transcriptional regulator of catabolic genes induced during P. aeruginosa growth in CF sputum.},

abstract = {We describe swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a third mode of surface translocation in addition to the previously described swimming and twitching motilities. Swarming in P. aeruginosa is induced on semisolid surfaces (0.5 to 0.7% agar) under conditions of nitrogen limitation and in response to certain amino acids. Glutamate, aspartate, histidine, or proline, when provided as the sole source of nitrogen, induced swarming, while arginine, asparagine, and glutamine, among other amino acids, did not sustain swarming. Cells from the edge of the swarm were about twice as long as cells from the swarm center. In both instances, bacteria possessing two polar flagella were observed by light and electron microscopy. While a fliC mutant of P. aeruginosa displayed slightly diminished swarming, a pilR and a pilA mutant, both deficient in type IV pili, were unable to swarm. Furthermore, cells with mutations in the las cell-to-cell signaling system showed diminished swarming behavior, while rhl mutants were completely unable to swarm. Evidence is presented for rhamnolipids being the actual surfactant involved in swarming motility, which explains the involvement of the cell-to-cell signaling circuitry of P. aeruginosa in this type of surface motility.},

abstract = {Facultative methylotrophic bacteria of the genus Methylobacterium are commonly found in association with plants. Inoculation experiments were performed to study the importance of methylotrophic metabolism for colonization of the model legume Medicago truncatula. Competition experiments with Methylobacterium extorquens wild-type strain AM1 and methylotrophy mutants revealed that the ability to use methanol as a carbon and energy source provides a selective advantage during colonization of M. truncatula. Differences in the fitness of mutants defective in different stages of methylotrophic metabolism were found; whereas approximately 25% of the mutant incapable of oxidizing methanol to formaldehyde (deficient in methanol dehydrogenase) was recovered, 10% or less of the mutants incapable of oxidizing formaldehyde to CO2 (defective in biosynthesis of the cofactor tetrahydromethanopterin) was recovered. Interestingly, impaired fitness of the mutant strains compared with the wild type was found on leaves and roots. Single-inoculation experiments showed, however, that mutants with defects in methylotrophy were capable of plant colonization at the wild-type level, indicating that methanol is not the only carbon source that is accessible to Methylobacterium while it is associated with plants. Fluorescence microscopy with a green fluorescent protein-labeled derivative of M. extorquens AM1 revealed that the majority of the bacterial cells on leaves were on the surface and that the cells were most abundant on the lower, abaxial side. However, bacterial cells were also found in the intercellular spaces inside the leaves, especially in the epidermal cell layer and immediately underneath this layer.},

abstract = {The increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome has become a serious public health problem. Certain bacteria-derived metabolites play a key role in maintaining human health by regulating the host metabolism. Recent evidence shows that indole-3-propionic acid content can be used to predict the occurrence and development of metabolic diseases. Supplementing indole-3-propionic acid can effectively improve metabolic disorders and is considered a promising metabolite. Therefore, this article systematically reviews the latest research on indole-3-propionic acid and elaborates its source of metabolism and its association with metabolic diseases. Indole-3-propionic acid can improve blood glucose and increase insulin sensitivity, inhibit liver lipid synthesis and inflammatory factors, correct intestinal microbial disorders, maintain the intestinal barrier, and suppress the intestinal immune response. The study of the mechanism of the metabolic benefits of indole-3-propionic acid is expected to be a potential compound for treating metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {Over the past 30 years, the majority of (pre)clinical efforts to find an effective therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) focused on clearing the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) from the brain since, according to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the peptide was (and it is still considered by many) the pathogenic determinant of this neurodegenerative disorder. However, as reviewed in this article, results from the numerous clinical trials that have tested anti-Abeta therapies to date indicate that this peptide plays a minor role in the pathogenesis of AD. Indeed, even Aducanumab and Lecanemab, the two antibodies recently approved by the FDA for AD therapy, as well as Donanemab showed limited efficacy on cognitive parameters in phase III clinical trials, despite their capability of markedly lowering Abeta brain load. Furthermore, preclinical evidence demonstrates that Abeta possesses several physiological functions, including memory formation, suggesting that AD may in part be due to a loss of function of this peptide. Finally, it is generally accepted that AD could be the result of many molecular dysfunctions, and therefore, if we keep chasing only Abeta, it means that we cannot see the forest for the trees.},

abstract = {The glymphatic system is a crucial component in preserving brain homeostasis by facilitating waste clearance from the central nervous system (CNS). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels facilitate the continuous interchange between cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstitial fluid by convective flow movement. This flow is responsible for guiding proteins and metabolites away from the CNS. Proteinopathies are neurological conditions characterized by the accumulation of aggregated proteins or peptides in the brain. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides causes the formation of senile plaques. This accumulation has been hypothesized to be a result of the imbalance between Abeta production and clearance. Recent studies have shown that an extended form of AQP4 increases Abeta clearance from the brain. In this mini-review, we present a summary of these findings and explore the potential for future therapeutic strategies aiming to boost waste clearance in AD.},

abstract = {Regulation of translation via stop codon readthrough (SC-RT) expands not only tissue-specific but also viral proteomes in humans and, therefore, represents an important subject of study. Understanding this mechanism and all involved players is critical also from a point of view of prospective medical therapies of hereditary diseases caused by a premature termination codon. tRNAs were considered for a long time to be just passive players delivering amino acid residues according to the genetic code to ribosomes without any active regulatory roles. In contrast, our recent yeast work identified several endogenous tRNAs implicated in the regulation of SC-RT. Swiftly emerging studies of human tRNA-ome also advocate that tRNAs have unprecedented regulatory potential. Here, we developed a universal U6 promotor-based system expressing various human endogenous tRNA iso-decoders to study consequences of their increased dosage on SC-RT employing various reporter systems in vivo. This system combined with siRNA-mediated downregulations of selected aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases demonstrated that changing levels of human tryptophan and tyrosine tRNAs do modulate efficiency of SC-RT. Overall, our results suggest that tissue-to-tissue specific levels of selected near-cognate tRNAs may have a vital potential to fine-tune the final landscape of the human proteome, as well as that of its viral pathogens.},

abstract = {The relationship between skeletal muscle and cognitive disorders has drawn increasing attention. This study aims to examine the associations of sarcopenia with cognitive function and dementia risk score. Data on 1978 participants (aged 65 years and older) from the 2011 wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, with four follow-up waves to 2018, were used. Cognitive function was assessed by four dimensions, with a lower score indicating lower cognitive function. Dementia risk was assessed by a risk score using the Rotterdam Study Basic Dementia Risk Model (BDRM), with a higher score indicating a greater risk. Sarcopenia was defined when low muscle mass plus low muscle strength or low physical performance were met. We used generalized estimating equations to examine the associations of sarcopenia. In the fully adjusted models, sarcopenia was significantly associated with lower cognitive function (standardized, = 0.15; 95% CIs: 0.26, 0.04) and a higher BDRM score (standardized, = 0.42; 95% CIs: 0.29, 0.55). Our findings may provide a new avenue for alleviating the burden of cognitive disorders by preventing sarcopenia.},

abstract = {Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC, Long COVID) pose a significant global health challenge. The pathophysiology is unknown, and no effective treatments have been found to date. Several hypotheses have been formulated to explain the etiology of PASC, including viral persistence, chronic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and autonomic dysfunction. Here, we propose a mechanism that links all four hypotheses in a single pathway and provides actionable insights for therapeutic interventions. We find that PASC are associated with serotonin reduction. Viral infection and type I interferon-driven inflammation reduce serotonin through three mechanisms: diminished intestinal absorption of the serotonin precursor tryptophan; platelet hyperactivation and thrombocytopenia, which impacts serotonin storage; and enhanced MAO-mediated serotonin turnover. Peripheral serotonin reduction, in turn, impedes the activity of the vagus nerve and thereby impairs hippocampal responses and memory. These findings provide a possible explanation for neurocognitive symptoms associated with viral persistence in Long COVID, which may extend to other post-viral syndromes.},

abstract = {Host microbial cross-talk is essential to maintain intestinal homeostasis. However, maladaptation of this response through microbial dysbiosis or defective host defense toward invasive intestinal bacteria can result in chronic inflammation. We have shown that macrophages differentiated in the presence of the bacterial metabolite butyrate display enhanced antimicrobial activity. Butyrate-induced antimicrobial activity was associated with a shift in macrophage metabolism, a reduction in mTOR kinase activity, increased LC3-associated host defenseand anti-microbialpeptide production in the absence of an increased inflammatory cytokine response. Butyrate drove this monocyte to macrophage differentiation program through histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibition. Administration of butyrate induced antimicrobial activity in intestinal macrophages invivo and increased resistance to enteropathogens. Our data suggest that (1) increased intestinal butyrate might represent a strategy to bolster host defense without tissue damaging inflammation and (2) that pharmacological HDAC3 inhibition might drive selective macrophage functions toward antimicrobial host defense.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of rare neurogenetic disorders frequently associated with iron accumulation in the basal nuclei of the brain characterized by progressive spasticity, dystonia, muscle rigidity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and retinal degeneration or optic nerve atrophy. Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is one of the most widespread NBIA subtypes. It is caused by mutations in the gene of pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) that result in dysfunction in PANK2 enzyme activity, with consequent deficiency of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, as well as low levels of essential metabolic intermediates such as 4'-phosphopantetheine, a necessary cofactor for essential cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins. METHODS: In this manuscript, we examined the therapeutic effectiveness of pantothenate, panthetine, antioxidants (vitamin E and omega 3) and mitochondrial function boosting supplements (L-carnitine and thiamine) in mutant PANK2 cells with residual expression levels. RESULTS: Commercial supplements, pantothenate, pantethine, vitamin E, omega 3, carnitine and thiamine were able to eliminate iron accumulation, increase PANK2, mtACP, and NFS1 expression levels and improve pathological alterations in mutant cells with residual PANK2 expression levels. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that several commercial compounds are indeed able to significantly correct the mutant phenotype in cellular models of PKAN. These compounds alone or in combinations are of common use in clinical practice and may be useful for the treatment of PKAN patients with residual enzyme expression levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) disorders are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that have in common the accumulation of iron in the basal nuclei of the brain which are essential components of the extrapyramidal system. Frequent symptoms are progressive spasticity, dystonia, muscle rigidity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and retinal degeneration or optic nerve atrophy. One of the most prevalent subtypes of NBIA is Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN). It is caused by pathogenic variants in the gene of pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) which encodes the enzyme responsible for the first reaction on the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway. Thus, deficient PANK2 activity induces CoA deficiency as well as low expression levels of 4'-phosphopantetheinyl proteins which are essential for mitochondrial metabolism. METHODS: This study is aimed at evaluating the role of alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA) in reversing the pathological alterations in fibroblasts and induced neurons derived from PKAN patients. Iron accumulation, lipid peroxidation, transcript and protein expression levels of PANK2, mitochondrial ACP (mtACP), 4''-phosphopantetheinyl and lipoylated proteins, as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and Complex I activity were examined. RESULTS: Treatment with alpha-LA was able to correct all pathological alterations in responsive mutant fibroblasts with residual PANK2 enzyme expression. However, alpha-LA had no effect on mutant fibroblasts with truncated/incomplete protein expression. The positive effect of alpha-LA in particular pathogenic variants was also confirmed in induced neurons derived from mutant fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that alpha-LA treatment can increase the expression levels of PANK2 and reverse the mutant phenotype in PANK2 responsive pathogenic variants. The existence of residual enzyme expression in some affected individuals raises the possibility of treatment using high dose of alpha-LA.},

abstract = {Soil pollution is one of the most serious environmental problems globally due to the weak self-purification ability, long degradation time, and high cost of cleaning soil pollution. The pollutants in the soil can be transported into the human body through water or dust, causing adverse effects on human health. The latest research has shown that the clean-up of soil pollutants through microbial consortium is a very promising method. This review provides an in-depth discussion on the efficient removal, bio-adsorption, or carbonated precipitation of organic and inorganic pollutants by the microbial consortium, including PAHs, BPS, BPF, crude oil, pyrene, DBP, DOP, TPHP, PHs, butane, DON, TC, Mn, and Cd. In view of the good degradation ability of the consortium compared to single strains, six different synergistic mechanisms and corresponding microorganisms are summarized. The microbial consortium obtains such activities through enhancing synergistic degradation, reducing the accumulation of intermediate products, generating the crude enzyme, and self-regulating, etc. Furthermore, the degradation efficiency of pollutants can be greatly improved by adding chemical materials such as the surfactants Tween 20, Tween 80, and SDS. This review provides insightful information regarding the application of microbial consortia for soil pollutant removal.},

abstract = {Four bacterial strains identified as members of the Acidovorax genus were isolated from two geographically distinct but similarly contaminated soils in North Carolina, USA, characterized, and their genomes sequenced. Their 16S rRNA genes were highly similar to those previously recovered during stable-isotope probing (SIP) of one of the soils with the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) phenanthrene. Heterotrophic growth of all strains occurred with a number of organic acids, as well as phenanthrene, but no other tested PAHs. Optimal growth occurred aerobically under mesophilic temperature, neutral pH, and low salinity conditions. Predominant fatty acids were C16:17c/C16:16c, C16:0, and C18:17c, and were consistent with the genus. Genomic G+C contents ranged from 63.6 to 64.2%. A combination of whole genome comparisons and physiological analyses indicated that these four strains likely represent a single species within the Acidovorax genus. Chromosomal genes for phenanthrene degradation to phthalate were nearly identical to highly conserved regions in phenanthrene-degrading Delftia, Burkholderia, Alcaligenes, and Massilia species in regions flanked by transposable or extrachromosomal elements. The lower degradation pathway for phenanthrene metabolism was inferred by comparisons to described genes and proteins. The novel species Acidovorax carolinensis sp. nov. is proposed, comprising the four strains described in this study with strain NA3T as the type strain (=LMG 30136, =DSM 105008).},
