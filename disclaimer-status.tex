Documents labelled "NOTES" or "not public" contain
substantial informal or speculative content that
may be terse and poorly edited or even sarcastic or profane.
Documents labelled as "public" have generally been edited
to be more coherent but probably have not been reviewed
or proof read. 

Generally non-public documents are labelled as such to avoid
confusion and embarassment and should be read with that understanding.
