abstract = {The amyloid cascade hypothesis, focusing on pathological proteins aggregation, has so far failed to uncover the root cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), or to provide an effective therapy. This traditional paradigm essentially explains a mechanism involved in the development of sporadic AD rather than its cause. The failure of an overwhelming majority of clinical studies (99.6%) demonstrates that a breakthrough in therapy would be difficult if not impossible without understanding the etiology of AD. It becomes more and more apparent that the AD pathology might originate from brain infection. In this review, we discuss a potential role of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and eukaryotic parasites as triggers of AD pathology. We show evidence from the current literature that amyloid beta, traditionally viewed as pathological, actually acts as an antimicrobial peptide, protecting the brain against pathogens. However, in case of a prolonged or excessive activation of a senescent immune system, amyloid beta accumulation and aggregation becomes damaging and supports runaway neurodegenerative processes in AD. This is paralleled by the recent study by Alam and colleagues (2022) who showed that alpha-synuclein, the protein accumulating in synucleinopathies, also plays a critical physiological role in immune reactions and inflammation, showing an unforeseen link between the 2 unrelated classes of neurodegenerative disorders. The multiplication of the amyloid precursor protein gene, recently described by Lee and collegues (2018), and possible reactivation of human endogenous retroviruses by pathogens fits well into the same picture. We discuss these new findings from the viewpoint of the infection hypothesis of AD and offer suggestions for future research.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Microbial infections of the brain can lead to dementia, and for many decades microbial infections have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, a causal role for infection in AD remains contentious, and the lack of standardized detection methodologies has led to inconsistent detection/identification of microbes in AD brains. There is a need for a consensus methodology; the Alzheimer's Pathobiome Initiative aims to perform comparative molecular analyses of microbes in <jats:italic>post mortem</jats:italic> brains versus cerebrospinal fluid, blood, olfactory neuroepithelium, oral/nasopharyngeal tissue, bronchoalveolar, urinary, and gut/stool samples. Diverse extraction methodologies, polymerase chain reaction and sequencing techniques, and bioinformatic tools will be evaluated, in addition to direct microbial culture and metabolomic techniques. The goal is to provide a roadmap for detecting infectious agents in patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD. Positive findings would then prompt tailoring of antimicrobial treatments that might attenuate or remit mounting clinical deficits in a subset of patients.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The effect of L-tryptophan on root elongation of lettuce seedlings (Lactuca sativa), as well as on allelochemical activity of three species of root growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), was studied under controlled axenic conditions. L-Tryptophan exhibited an hormonelike effect, promoting root elongation of lettuce seedlings at 10minus5 and 10minus3 mM by ca. 20{\%}, but at 10 mM, root elongation was inhibited by ca. 52{\%} compared to the control (L-tryptophan-free). Comamonas acidovorans 26, Agrobacterium sp., and Alcaligenes piechaudii promoted root elongation of lettuce seedlings by 15, 30, and 44{\%}, respectively. When 10 mM L-tryptophan was applied, Agrobacterium sp. and A. piechaudii inhibited root elongation by 57.6 and 63.5{\%}, respectively. However, at the same concentration of L-tryptophan, C. acidovorans 26 promoted root growth. It is suggested that L-tryptophan reverted root growth promotion through enhancing the secretion of indole-3-acetic acid by the rhizobacteria. L-Tryptophan may have both a direct effect on root growth and an indirect effect through affecting activity of root growth-mediating bacteria. Since the growth of C. acidovorans 26 was exclusively inhibited by L-tryptophan (10 mM), it is conjectured that reduced population of this bacterium could not generate IAA at a level sufficient to inhibit root elongation. Despite the mild root growth promoting effect of C. acidovorans 26, its consistent root growth promotion, perhaps justifies further experimentation.},

abstract = {<jats:p>Probabilistic and parsimony-based arguments regarding available genetics data are used to propose that Hardy and Higgin's amyloid cascade hypothesis is valid but is commonly interpreted too narrowly to support, incorrectly, the primacy of the amyloid-upbeta peptide (Aupbeta) in driving Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Instead, increased activity of the upbetaCTF (C99) fragment of AupbetaPP is the critical pathogenic determinant altered by mutations in the APP gene. This model is consistent with the regulation of APP mRNA translation via its 5' iron responsive element. Similar arguments support that the pathological effects of familial Alzheimer's disease mutations in the genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 are not exerted directly via changes in AupbetaPP cleavage to produce different ratios of Aupbeta length. Rather, these mutations likely act through effects on presenilin holoprotein conformation and function, and possibly the formation and stability of multimers of presenilin holoprotein and/or of the upgamma-secretase complex. All fAD mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 likely find unity of pathological mechanism in their actions on endolysosomal acidification and mitochondrial function, with detrimental effects on iron homeostasis and promotion of Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]pseudo-hypoxiaUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] being of central importance. Aupbeta production is enhanced and distorted by oxidative stress and accumulates due to decreased lysosomal function. It may act as a disease-associated molecular pattern enhancing oxidative stress-driven neuroinflammation during the cognitive phase of the disease.</jats:p>},

The serotonergic system is also impaired and may contribute both to cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms in SDAT. To investigate this further we assessed the effects of lowering brain serotonin using the technique of acute tryptophan depletion on cognitive function in patients with SDAT and in age matched control subjects.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method.</jats:bold> Sixteen patients with probable SDAT and 17 healthy elderly subjects received two amino acid drinks in a within subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced, crossover design. One of the drinks was nutritionally balanced and contained tryptophan (placebo), the other was identical but contained no tryptophan. A battery of detailed neuropsychological tests was performed between 4 and 6 h after the drink. Mood rating scales and other ratings of behavioural and emotional symptoms were also performed on both occasions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold> Acute tryptophan depletion resulted in impairment on tasks of working memory in both groups. There was no group specific effect. Female SDAT subjects performed better on a task of pattern recognition during acute tryptophan depletion compared with placebo. There were no changes in behavioural symptoms during acute tryptophan depletion in either group.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion.</jats:bold> Compromised serotonergic function may be an important contributor to cognitive decline in SDAT and in ageing. Strategies targeting specific 5HT receptors may be helpful in SDAT.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>The need to identify new potentially druggable biochemical mechanisms for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an ongoing priority. The therapeutic limitations of amyloid-based approaches are further motivating this search. Amino acid metabolism, particularly tryptophan metabolism, has the potential to emerge as a leading candidate and an alternative exploitable biomolecular target. Multiple avenues support this contention. Tryptophan (trp) and its associated metabolites are able to inhibit various enzymes participating in the biosynthesis of upbeta-amyloid, and one metabolite, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, is able to directly inhibit neurotoxic upbeta-amyloid oligomerization; however, whilst certain trp metabolites are neuroprotectant, other metabolites, such as quinolinic acid, are directly toxic to neurons and may themselves contribute to AD progression. Trp metabolites also have the ability to influence microglia and associated cytokines in order to modulate the neuroinflammatory and neuroimmune factors which trigger pro-inflammatory cytotoxicity in AD. Finally, trp and various metabolites, including melatonin, are regulators of sleep, with disorders of sleep being an important risk factor for the development of AD. Thus, the involvement of trp biochemistry in AD is multifactorial and offers a plethora of druggable targets in the continuing quest for AD therapeutics.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is likely associated with systemic immune activation. During immune response, interferon-gamma stimu-lates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) converting tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine followed by kynurenine in an ensuing step. Thus, IDO activity is estimated by the kynurenine per tryptophan quotient (Kyn/Trp). In 21 patients suffering from AD, in 20 controls of similar age, and in 49 blood donors we measured serum tryptophan and kynurenine concentrations by HPLC. Lower tryptophan concentrations were found in elderly control subjects compared to blood donors (62.1 vs. 73.0 $\mu$M, p < 0.005). Tryptophan concentrations tended to be still lower in AD patients (54.4 $\mu$M, p = 0.07) compared to elderly controls. Enhanced tryptophan degradation in patients was reflected by significantly increased Kyn/Trp (46.1 vs. 34.1 in elderly controls, p < 0.05). Correlations were found in patients between Kyn/Trp and concentrations of soluble immune markers in serum, i.e., neopterin, interleukin-2 receptor and tumor necrosis factor receptor (all p < 0.001). Increased Kyn/Trp was associated with reduced cognitive performance. Tryptophan degradation due to immune activation may exert impact on the pathogenesis of AD.},

abstract = {Vitamin K is a fat-soluble nutrient discovered in 1935 and its role in blood coagulation has been thoroughly explored. In recent years, studies conducted in vitro and on animals highlighted vitamin K involvement in brain cells development and survival. In particular, vitamin K seems to have an antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effect mediated by the activation of Growth Arrest Specific Gene 6 and Protein S. Moreover, this vitamin is involved in sphingolipids metabolism, a class of lipids that participate in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of brain cells. An altered expression in sphingolipids profile has been related to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This review stems from a growing interest in the role of vitamin K in brain functions, especially in cognition, also in view of an expected increase of prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. It collects recent researches that show interesting, even though not definitive, evidence of a direct correlation between vitamin K levels and cognitive performance. Moreover, vitamin K antagonists, used worldwide as oral anticoagulants, according to recent studies may have a negative influence on cognitive domains such as visual memory, verbal fluency and brain volume. The aim of this review is to analyze the evidence of clinical studies carried out up to date on the relationship between vitamin K intake and cognitive performances. The involvement of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in declining cognitive performances is also addressed separately.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Pseudomonas putida</jats:italic> is a soil bacterium with a versatile and robust metabolism. When confronted with mixtures of carbon sources, it prioritizes the utilization of the preferred compounds, optimizing metabolism and growth. This response is particularly strong when growing in a complex medium such as LB. This work examines the changes occurring in <jats:italic>P. putida</jats:italic> KT2440 metabolic fluxes, while it grows exponentially in LB medium and sequentially consumes the compounds available. Integrating the uptake rates for each compound at three different moments during the exponential growth with the changes observed in the proteome, and with the metabolic fluxes predicted by the <jats:italic>i</jats:italic>JN1411 metabolic model for this strain, allowed the metabolic rearrangements that occurred to be determined. The results indicate that the bacterium changes significantly the configuration of its metabolism during the early, mid and late exponential phases of growth. Sugars served as an energy source during the early phase and later as energy and carbon source. The configuration of the tricarboxylic acids cycle varied during growth, providing no energy in the early phase, and turning to a reductive mode in the mid phase and to an oxidative mode later on. This work highlights the dynamism and flexibility of <jats:italic>P. putida</jats:italic> metabolism.</jats:p>},

abstract = {The Lascaux Cave contains a remarkable set of paintings from the Upper Palaeolithic. Shortly after discovery in 1940, the cave was modified for public viewing and, in 2001, was invaded by a Fusarium solani species complex. Benzalkonium chloride was used from 2001 to 2004 to eliminate the fungal outbreak. In this study, we carried out a sampling in most of the cave halls and galleries. Sequence analysis and isolation methods detected that the most abundant genera of bacteria were Ralstonia and Pseudomonas. We suggest that, as a result of years of benzalkonium chloride treatments, the indigenous microbial community has been replaced by microbial populations selected by biocide application.},

abstract = {<jats:p> Glutarate is an attractive dicarboxylate with various applications. Clarification of the regulatory mechanism of glutarate catabolism could help to block the glutarate catabolic pathways, thereby improving glutarate production through biotechnological routes. Glutarate is a toxic metabolite in humans, and its accumulation leads to a hereditary metabolic disorder, glutaric aciduria type I. The elucidation of the functions of CsiR and GcdR as regulators that respond to glutarate could help in the design of glutarate biosensors for the rapid detection of glutarate in patients with glutaric aciduria type I. In addition, CsiR was identified as a regulator that also regulates <jats:sc>l</jats:sc> -2-HG metabolism. The identification of CsiR as a regulator that responds to <jats:sc>l-</jats:sc> 2-HG could help in the discovery and investigation of other regulatory proteins involved in <jats:sc>l-</jats:sc> 2-HG catabolism. </jats:p>},

abstract = {A lead-resistant bacterial strain was isolated from coal mine dump and identified as Acinetobacter junii Pb1 on basis of 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) gene sequencing. The minimum inhibitory concentration of lead for the strain was 16,000\NBSPmg\NBSPlminus1 and it showed antibiotic and multi metal resistance. In aqueous culture, at an initial lead (Pb(II)) concentration of 100 and 500\NBSPmg\NBSPlminus1, lead adsorption and accumulation by the isolate was 100 and 60{\%}, at pH 7 at 30\NBSP{\textdegree}C after 48 and 120\NBSPh, respectively. The two fractions of exopolysaccharide (EPS), loosely associated EPS (laEPS) and bound EPS (bEPS), and whole cells (devoid of EPS) showed high binding affinity towards Pb(II). The binding affinity of laEPS towards Pb(II) (1071\NBSPmg\NBSPPb\NBSPgminus1) was three times higher than that of bEPS (321.5\NBSPmg\NBSPPb\NBSPgminus1) and 6.5 times higher than that of whole cells (165\NBSPmg\NBSPPb\NBSPgminus1). The binding affinity of EPS and whole cells with Pb(II), reported in the current study, is considerably higher as compared to that reported in the literature, till date. SEM analysis, showed an increase in thickness of cells on exposure to Pb(II) and TEM analysis, revealed its accumulation (interior of cell) and its adsorption (with the external cell surface). The isolate was also found to be positive for indole acetic acid (IAA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase production which helps in promoting plant growth. Thus, this study provides a new understanding towards Pb(II) uptake by A. junii Pb1, highlighting its potential on the restoration of Pb(II) contaminated repositories.},

abstract = {In this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (VB) and through cesarean section (CB) were investigated using culture-independent 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing approach. The results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of VB infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart CB infants. The intestinal microbiota of infants delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. The most abundant bacterial species present in VB infants were Acinetobacter sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Staphylococcus sp. However, CB infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. The intestinal microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of Bifidobacteria species. An interesting finding of our study was recovery of large number of Acinetobacter sp. consisting of Acinetobacter pittii (former Acinetobacter genomic species 3), Acinetobacter junii and Acinetobacter baumannii in the VB infants clone library. Among these, Acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and Acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus--Acinetobacter baumannii (ACB) complex. Although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.},

abstract = {Background: The possible relation between antibiotic exposure and the alteration of gut microbiota, which may affect dementia risk, has been revealed. However, the association between antibiotics and dementia incidence has rarely been studied. We aimed to determine the association between antibiotic exposure and the risk of dementia.Methods: This population-based retrospective cohort study used data from the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) in South Korea. Exposure was the cumulative days of antibiotic prescription from 2002 to 2005. Newly diagnosed overall dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD) were identified based on diagnostic codes and prescriptions for dementia-related drugs. The follow-up investigation was carried out from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013. The Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between cumulative antibiotic prescription days and dementia incidence.Results: A total of 313,161 participants were analyzed in this study. Compared to antibiotic non-users, the participants who used antibiotics for 91 or more days had an increased risk of overall dementia [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.74], AD (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.17-1.81), and VD (aHR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.83-2.30). Those who used five or more antibiotic classes had higher risks of overall dementia (aHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.66) and AD (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.00-1.78) than antibiotic non-users.Conclusion: Antibiotic exposure may increase the risk of dementia in a cumulative duration-dependent manner among adult participants. Future studies are needed to assess the causality between the long-term prescription of antibiotics and dementia risk.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Electromicrobiology is an emerging field investigating and exploiting the interaction of microorganisms with insoluble electron donors or acceptors. Some of the most recently categorized electroactive microorganisms became of interest to sustainable bioengineering practices. However, laboratories worldwide typically maintain electroactive microorganisms on soluble substrates, which often leads to a decrease or loss of the ability to effectively exchange electrons with solid electrode surfaces. In order to develop future sustainable technologies, we cannot rely solely on existing lab-isolates. Therefore, we must develop isolation strategies for environmental strains with electroactive properties superior to strains in culture collections. In this article, we provide an overview of the studies that isolated or enriched electroactive microorganisms from the environment using an anode as the sole electron acceptor (electricity-generating microorganisms) or a cathode as the sole electron donor (electricity-consuming microorganisms). Next, we recommend a selective strategy for the isolation of electroactive microorganisms. Furthermore, we provide a practical guide for setting up electrochemical reactors and highlight crucial electrochemical techniques to determine electroactivity and the mode of electron transfer in novel organisms.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>There is no cure or effective treatment for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, mainly because the etiology of these diseases remains elusive. Recent data suggest that unique changes in the gut microbial composition are associated with these ailments; however, our current understanding of the bacterial role in the pathogenesis of PCDs is hindered by the complexity of the microbial communities associated with specific microbiomes, such as the gut, oral, or vaginal microbiota. The composition of these specific microbiomes is regarded as a unique fingerprint affected by factors such as infections, diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics. All of these factors also affect the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of studies that reveal microbial contribution are correlational, and various models, including worm, fly, and mouse, are being utilized to decipher the role of individual microbes that may affect disease onset and progression. Recent evidence from across model organisms and humans shows a positive correlation between the presence of gram-negative enteropathogenic bacteria and the pathogenesis of PCDs.

abstract_as_rcvd = {<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title> <jats:p>There is no cure or effective treatment for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer‚s or Parkinson‚s diseases, mainly because the etiology of these diseases remains elusive. Recent data suggest that unique changes in the gut microbial composition are associated with these ailments; however, our current understanding of the bacterial role in the pathogenesis of PCDs is hindered by the complexity of the microbial communities associated with specific microbiomes, such as the gut, oral, or vaginal microbiota. The composition of these specific microbiomes is regarded as a unique fingerprint affected by factors such as infections, diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics. All of these factors also affect the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of studies that reveal microbial contribution are correlational, and various models, including worm, fly, and mouse, are being utilized to decipher the role of individual microbes that may affect disease onset and progression. Recent evidence from across model organisms and humans shows a positive correlation between the presence of gram-negative enteropathogenic bacteria and the pathogenesis of PCDs. While these correlational studies do not provide a mechanistic explanation, they do reveal contributing bacterial species and provide an important basis for further investigation. One of the lurking concerns related to the microbial contribution to PCDs is the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance and poor antibiotic stewardship, which ultimately select for proteotoxic bacteria, especially the gram-negative species that are known for intrinsic resistance. In this review, we summarize what is known about individual microbial contribution to PCDs and the potential impact of increasing antimicrobial resistance.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Methanol has been historically considered an exogenous product that leads only to pathological changes in the human body when consumed. However, in normal, healthy individuals, methanol and its short-lived oxidized product, formaldehyde, are naturally occurring compounds whose functions and origins have received limited attention. There are several sources of human physiological methanol. Fruits, vegetables, and alcoholic beverages are likely the main sources of exogenous methanol in the healthy human body. Metabolic methanol may occur as a result of fermentation by gut bacteria and metabolic processes involving S-adenosyl methionine. Regardless of its source, low levels of methanol in the body are maintained by physiological and metabolic clearance mechanisms. Although human blood contains small amounts of methanol and formaldehyde, the content of these molecules increases sharply after receiving even methanol-free ethanol, indicating an endogenous source of the metabolic methanol present at low levels in the blood regulated by a cluster of genes. Recent studies of the pathogenesis of neurological disorders indicate metabolic formaldehyde as a putative causative agent. The detection of increased formaldehyde content in the blood of both neurological patients and the elderly indicates the important role of genetic and biochemical mechanisms of maintaining low levels of methanol and formaldehyde.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Microorganisms capable of anaerobic nitrate-dependent Fe(II) (ferrous iron) oxidation (ANDFO) contribute significantly to iron and nitrogen cycling in various environments. However, lab efforts in continuous cultivation of ANDFO strains suffer from loss of activity when ferrous iron is used as sole electron donor. Here, we used a novel strain of nitrate-dependent Fe(II)-oxidizing bacterium Bacillus ferroxidians as a model and focused on the physiological activity of cells during ANDFO. It was shown that B. ferrooxidans entered a metabolically inactive state during ANDFO. B. ferrooxidans exhibited nitrate reduction coupled with Fe(II) oxidation, and the activity gradually declined and was hardly detected after 48-h incubation. Propidium monoazide (PMA) assisted 16S rRNA gene real-time PCR suggested that a large number of B. ferrooxidans cells were alive during incubation. However, <sup>2</sup>H(D)-isotope based Raman analysis indicated that the cells were metabolically inactive after 120-h of ANDFO. These inactive cells re-awakened in R2A medium and were capable of growth and reproduction, which was consistent with results in Raman analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation and x-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed the formation of Fe minerals in close proximity of cells in the Fe(II)-oxidizing medium after Fe(II) oxidation. Overall, our results demonstrated that continued ANDFO can induce a metabolically inactive state in B. ferrooxidans, which was responsible for the loss of activity during ANDFO. This study provides an insight into the ANDFO process and its contribution to iron and nitrogen cycling in the environments.},

abstract = {Phosphorus is critical for the regulation of numerous metabolic processes in plants, and so understanding the mechanisms by which plants acquire phosphorus is important. Phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) are thought to promote the uptake of phosphorus by plants. The effects of PSB YJILJH and YJ101 strains on the growth of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were investigated through the production of the plant hormone IAA and the change of available phosphorus content in the soil. Two strains of YJILJH and YJ101 were selected from the rhizosphere soil of white clover among rows of apple orchards. Combined with 16S rDNA and next-generation sequencing (NGS), the strains were identified as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. The two strains had strong phosphate solubilizing ability, and had solubilization index (SI) values of 4.39 and 3.95, respectively. The dissolved amounts of soy lecithin were 351.2 and 387.3\NBSPmg/L in liquid medium, respectively. The amount of Ca3(PO4)2 dissolved reached 506.3 and 789.8\NBSPmg/L, respectively. The pot experiment showed that the biomass of white clover after adding the two strains increased by 21.17{\%} and 36.49{\%}, the total phosphorus (TP) content increased by 28.87{\%} and 30.41{\%}, and the soil available phosphorus (AP) content increased by 86.63{\%} and 47.16{\%}, respectively. This study also found that both strains can produce IAA content reaching 55.95 and 54.33\NBSPpmol / L in 72\NBSPh. In regard to relative gene expression, trpD and trpA genes were expressed in the different treatments, while ipdC was only expressed in Luria-Bertani broth (LB broth) and NBRIP media (+ soy lecithin). It is speculated that the pathway of IAA synthesis by both strains may be related to the tryptophan side chain pathway and the indole-3-pyruvate pathway. The IAA produced by the two bacteria strains is an important reason to promote the growth of white clover and participate in the process of reducing the environmental pH of the growth medium.},

Results: We found that the abundance of several bacteria taxa in AD patients was different from that in HC at the genus level, such as Anaerostipes, Mitsuokella, Prevotella, Bosea, Fusobacterium, Anaerotruncus, Clostridium, and Coprobacillus. Interestingly, the abundance of Akkermansia, an emerging probiotic, increased significantly in the AD group compared with that in the HC group. Meanwhile, the quantity of traditional probiotic Bifidobacteria of the AD group also rose. Conclusion: These alterations in fecal microbiome of the AD group indicate that patients with mild AD have unique gut microbial characteristics.

abstract = {<jats:p>The rhizosphere is a microhabitat where there is an intense chemical dialogue between plants and microorganisms. The two coexist and develop synergistic actions, which can promote plants' functions and productivity, but also their capacity to respond to stress conditions, including heavy metal (HM) contamination. If HMs are present in soils used for agriculture, there is a risk of metal uptake by edible plants with subsequent bioaccumulation in humans and animals and detrimental consequences for their health. Plant productivity can also be negatively affected. Many bacteria have defensive mechanisms for resisting heavy metals and, through various complex processes, can improve plant response to HM stress. Bacteria-plant synergic interactions in the rhizosphere, as a homeostatic ecosystem response to HM disturbance, are common in soil. However, this is hard to achieve in agroecosystems managed with traditional practices, because concentrating on maximizing crop yield does not make it possible to establish rhizosphere interactions. Improving knowledge of the complex interactions mediated by plant exudates and secondary metabolites can lead to nature-based solutions for plant health in HM contaminated soils. This paper reports the main ecotoxicological effects of HMs and the various compounds (including several secondary metabolites) produced by plant-microorganism holobionts for removing, immobilizing and containing toxic elements.</jats:p>},

Plant productivity can also be negatively affected. Many bacteria have defensive mechanisms for resisting heavy metals and, through various complex processes, can improve plant response to HM stress. Bacteria-plant synergic interactions in the rhizosphere, as a homeostatic ecosystem response to HM disturbance, are common in soil. However, this is hard to achieve in agroecosystems managed with traditional practices, because concentrating on maximizing crop yield does not make it possible to establish rhizosphere interactions. Improving knowledge of the complex interactions mediated by plant exudates and secondary metabolites can lead to nature-based solutions for plant health in HM contaminated soils. This paper reports the main ecotoxicological effects of HMs and the various compounds (including several secondary metabolites) produced by plant-microorganism holobionts for removing, immobilizing and containing toxic elements.</jats:p>},

In this paper, I demonstrated not only anticoagulant activity but also coagulant activity of sulfatide in vivo by using experimental animal models and presented the possibility that sulfatide may function contradictorily under physiological and/or pathological conditions. For instance, I presented possible involvement of sulfatide in thrombotic diseases associated with cancers.},

abstract = {We recently showed that methanol emitted by wounded plants might function as a signaling molecule for plant-to-plant and plant-to-animal communications. In mammals, methanol is considered a poison because the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts methanol into toxic formaldehyde. However, the detection of methanol in the blood and exhaled air of healthy volunteers suggests that methanol may be a chemical with specific functions rather than a metabolic waste product. Using a genome-wide analysis of the mouse brain, we demonstrated that an increase in blood methanol concentration led to a change in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes primarily involved in detoxification processes and regulation of the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases gene cluster. To test the role of ADH in the maintenance of low methanol concentration in the plasma, we used the specific ADH inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) and showed that intraperitoneal administration of 4-MP resulted in a significant increase in the plasma methanol, ethanol and formaldehyde concentrations. Removal of the intestine significantly decreased the rate of methanol addition to the plasma and suggested that the gut flora may be involved in the endogenous production of methanol. ADH in the liver was identified as the main enzyme for metabolizing methanol because an increase in the methanol and ethanol contents in the liver homogenate was observed after 4-MP administration into the portal vein. Liver mRNA quantification showed changes in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes involved in cell signalling and detoxification processes. We hypothesized that endogenous methanol acts as a regulator of homeostasis by controlling the mRNA synthesis.},

abstract = {The bacterial species Cutibacterium acnes (formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes) is tightly associated with humans. It is the dominant bacterium in sebaceous regions of the human skin, where it preferentially colonizes the pilosebaceous unit. Multiple strains of C. acnes that belong to phylogenetically distinct types can co-exist. In this review we summarize and discuss the current knowledge of C. acnes regarding bacterial properties and traits that allow host colonization and play major roles in host-bacterium interactions and also regarding the host responses that C. acnes can trigger. These responses can have beneficial or detrimental consequences for the host. In the first part of the review, we highlight and critically review disease associations of C. acnes, in particular acne vulgaris, implant-associated infections and native infections. Here, we also analyse the current evidence for a direct or indirect role of a C. acnes-related dysbiosis in disease development or progression, i.e., reduced C. acnes strain diversity and/or the predominance of a certain phylotype. In the second part of the review, we highlight historical and recent findings demonstrating beneficial aspects of colonization by C. acnes such as colonization resistance, immune system interactions, and oxidant protection, and discuss the molecular mechanisms behind these effects. This new insight led to efforts in skin microbiota manipulation, such as the use of C. acnes strains as probiotic options to treat skin disorders.},

For their application on crops, bacteria are provided in inoculant formulations that are continuously changing, with liquid- and solid-based products. Bacteria for inoculants are mainly selected from natural isolates. In nature, microorganisms that favor plants exhibit various strategies to succeed and prevail in the rhizosphere, such as biological nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization, and siderophore production. On the other hand, plants have strategies to maintain beneficial microorganisms, such as the exudation of chemoattractanst for specific microorganisms and signaling pathways that regulate plant-bacteria interactions. Transcriptomic approaches are helpful in attempting to elucidate plant-microorganism interactions. Here, we present a review of these issues.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p>Methanol is a natural ingredient with major occurrence in fruit spirits, such as apple, pear, plum or cherry spirits, but also in spirits made from coffee pulp. The compound is formed during fermentation and the following mash storage by enzymatic hydrolysis of naturally present pectins. Methanol is toxic above certain threshold levels and legal limits have been set in most jurisdictions. Therefore, the methanol content needs to be mitigated and its level must be controlled. This article will review the several factors that influence the methanol content including the pH value of the mash, the addition of various yeast and enzyme preparations, fermentation temperature, mash storage, and most importantly the raw material quality and hygiene. From all these mitigation possibilities, lowering the pH value and the use of cultured yeasts when mashing fruit substances is already common as best practice today. Also a controlled yeast fermentation at acidic pH facilitates not only reduced methanol formation, but ultimately also leads to quality benefits of the distillate. Special care has to be observed in the case of spirits made from coffee by-products which are prone to spoilage with very high methanol contents reported in past studies.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:p> Background: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are often prescribed for elderly patients without appropriate indication, or for longer durations than recommended. Objective: To review appropriateness of PPI use prior to and in hospital, and deprescribing rates across different hospital units. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients geq65 years admitted to 5 acute care units: intensive care unit, acute care for elderly, orthopedics, surgery, and medicine. Patients who were Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]non-naiveUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] (prehospital PPI use) or Ux201c[bad char  vv=8220]naiveUx201d[bad char  vv=8221] (new PPI initiated in hospital) users were included. For both groups, demographics, reason for admission, length of stay, comorbidities, name and number of home medications, PPI name, dose and indication, and PPI discharge instructions were collected. For naive patients, duration of in-hospital use and prescriber specialty was recorded. Results: Among non-naive patients (n = 377), for 37 patients (10%), the indication for a PPI was not appropriate, and for 92 patients (24%), the indication was unclear. Most patients had their home PPI continued while in hospital (87%) and at discharge (90%). Among naive (n = 93) patients, for 8 patients (9%), the indication for a PPI was not appropriate, and for 25 (27%) patients, the indication was unclear. PPI was prescribed to only 16 (18%) by the gastrointestinal consult service. Most patients had their new PPI continued at discharge (74%); only 7 (9%) were discharged with a plan to reassess PPI indication. Conclusion: PPIs are infrequently deprescribed during hospital admission, despite inappropriate or unclear indications for use. Thorough medication reconciliation, documentation of PPI indication and duration, and institutional focus on deprescribing are encouraged. </jats:p>},

abstract = {In the last few years, Indol-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) has been subjected to 5 pilot clinical trials in volunteers and a phase II study on patients affected by anxiety, with or without sleep problems. Overall, results indicated a very good safety profile, relief from anxiety and a better quality of sleep in patients treated with IPA. Moreover, the drug showed no withdrawal signs, but positive effects on mood, improving feelings of relaxation, calmness and happiness. The mechanism of action of IPA, depending on increased turnover of some indoles in the CNS, appears clearly distinct from that of benzodiazepines, suggesting that the drug might be used in the treatment of symptoms of mild anxiety and stress experienced by busy and anxious people.},

First, KYNA antagonizes in a non-competitive manner excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors (Perkins and Stone, 1982; Moroni et al., 1986); second, it prevents the excitotoxic actions of the related tryptophan (TRP) metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN) (Foster et al., 1984) and reduces neuronal damage after anoxic and ischemic brain insults (Germano et al., 1987); and third, it is present in mammalian biological fluids and in the central nervous system (Moroni et al., 1988b).},

abstract = {Indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) undergoes in solutions to the keto-enol tautomerism, which appears responsible of its pharmacological effects, as only the enol tautomer is an easy target for oxygen free-radicals and can be transformed directly to kynurenic acid (KYNA). Contrary to expectations, the IPA enol tautomer is rather stable in mammalian tissues, due to the presence of specific tautomerases, favouring the formation of KYNA in the presence of free-radicals. Because of the synergistic effects between glucocorticoids, free-radicals and excitatory aminoacids in chronic stress. the enol tautomer of IPA and KYNA are proposed as physiological metabolites produced in order to shut-off the chronic stress cycle.},

abstract = {<jats:p> Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), known as natural auxin, induces cleft palate in rodents. However, there has been no report about the neurodevelopmental toxicity of IAA in rats. In the present study, we found microencephaly in the fetuses from the rats exposed to IAA. The purpose of this work was to examine the effects of IAA administration in pregnant rats on neuroepithelial cells in the embryos/fetuses. IAA was administered at 500 and 1,000 mg/kg on gestation days (days) 12, 13, and 14, and then embryos/fetuses were harvested on days 14.5, 15, 16, and 21. Cleft palate was induced at 1,000 mg/kg. The brain in treated groups exhibited reduction in the size and weight on day 21 in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathologically, apoptotic cells were observed mainly in the medial and dorsal layer of the neuroepithelium at 500 and 1,000 mg/kg on day 14.5. On day 15, they were observed in the medial and dorsal layer of the neuroepithelium, and preplate at 1,000 mg/kg. On day 16, they existed in the dorsal layer of the neuroepithelium and intermediate zone in the embryos from 1 dam at 1,000 mg/kg. On day 21, an increase in cell proliferative activity was observed in the neuroepithelium at 500 and 1,000 mg/kg. The reduction of the cortical plate, the enlargement of the neuroepithelium and a slight increase in neuron density in the intermediate zone were observed at 1,000 mg/kg. These findings indicated IAA might induce the neuronal apoptosis in the S phase and lead to microencephaly. </jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The central nervous system (CNS) coordinates all our body functions. Neurons in the CNS parenchyma achieve this computational task by high speed communication via electrical and chemical signals and thus rely on a strictly regulated homeostatic environment, which does not tolerate uncontrolled entry of blood components including immune cells. The CNS thus has a unique relationship with the immune system known as CNS immune privilege. Previously ascribed to the presence of blood-brain barriers and the lack of lymphatic vessels in the CNS parenchyma prohibiting, respectively, efferent and afferent connections with the peripheral immune system, it is now appreciated that CNS immune surveillance is ensured by cellular and acellular brain barriers that limit immune cell and mediator accessibility to specific compartments at the borders of the CNS. CNS immune privilege is established by a brain barriers anatomy resembling the architecture of a medieval castle surrounded by two walls bordering a castle moat. Built for protection and defense this twowalled rampart at the outer perimeter of the CNS parenchyma allows for accommodation of different immune cell subsets and efficient monitoring of potential danger signals derived from inside or outside of the CNS parenchyma. It enables effective mounting of immune responses within the subarachnoid or perivascular spaces, while leaving the CNS parenchyma relatively undisturbed. In this study, we propose that CNS immune privilege rests on the proper function of the brain barriers, which allow for CNS immune surveillance but prohibit activation of immune responses from the CNS parenchyma unless it is directly injured.</jats:p>},
