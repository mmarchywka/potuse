abstract = {The development of methods for generating pure spin current at the molecular level is vital. In this work{,} we investigated how the spin-related photocurrent is produced in a cobalt phthalocyanine chain by the photogalvanic effect (PGE). Depending on how the magnetic moments of the left and right halves of the cobalt phthalocyanine chain are arranged{,} spin current can be generated. Both charge current and spin current are absent when the magnetic moments are arranged in parallel. Pure spin currents are generated when the magnetic moments are arranged in an antiparallel manner. Importantly{,} the pure spin current is robust to the polarization type and polarization angle. This characteristic results from the structure{'}s charge density having spatial inversion symmetry but lacking that of the spin density.},

abstract = {<jats:title>Significance</jats:title> <jats:p>Protein synthesis is a fundamental cellular process that occurs from bacteria to humans. Highly accurate protein synthesis has been shown to be critical for the fitness of the cell and is controlled by sophisticated molecular mechanisms. One such mechanism is the release of mature proteins at stop codons to prevent readthrough. Here we identify an environmental stress that substantially increases the level of stop-codon readthrough during protein synthesis in bacteria and provide insights into the underlying mechanism. Intriguingly, the level of readthrough fluctuates extensively among single cells that are genetically identical and grown under the same stress condition. Cells with different levels of readthrough vary in phenotypes, and individual cells with high readthrough recover better from the acid stress.</jats:p>},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>High-contact stresses generated at the sliding interfaces during their relative movement provide a unique combination of local heating and shear- and load-induced compression conditions. These conditions, when involving the sliding of surfaces with certain material characteristics, may facilitate tribochemical reactions with the environment, leading to the formation of a protective, damage-suppressing tribofilm directly at the contact. Here, we employ the electrodeposition process to design a coating composed of a hard cobalt-phosphorous matrix with the inclusion of tribocatalytically-active nickel clusters. The coating is optimized in terms of its relative composition and mechanical characteristics. We demonstrate the excellent tribological performance of the coating in the presence of a hydrocarbon environment, both in the form of a liquid lubricant and as a hydrocarbon-saturated vapor. Characterization of the wear track indicates that the origin of such performance lies in the formation of a protective carbon-based tribofilm on the surface of the coating during sliding. These results contribute to the advancement of knowledge on material transformations in the contact, thus providing a robust and versatile approach to addressing tribological challenges in mechanical systems.</jats:p>},

description = {Liquid droplets sliding along solid surfaces are a frequently observed phenomenon in nature, e.g., raindrops on a leaf, and in everyday situations, e.g., drops of water in a drinking glass. To model this situation, we use a phase field approach. The bulk model is given by the thermodynamically consistent Cahn- Hilliard Navier-Stokes model from [Abels et al., Math. Mod. Meth. Appl. Sc., 22(3), 2012]. To model the contact line dynamics we apply the generalized Navier boundary condition for the fluid and the dynamically advected boundary contact angle condition for the phase field as derived in [Qian et al., J. Fluid Mech., 564, 2006]. In recent years several schemes were proposed to solve this model numerically. While they widely differ in terms of complexity, they all fulfill certain basic properties when it comes to thermodynamic consistency. However, an accurate comparison of the influence of the schemes on the moving contact line is rarely found. Therefore, we thoughtfully compare the quality of the numerical results obtained with three different schemes and two different bulk energy potentials. Especially, we discuss the influence of the different schemes on the apparent contact angles of a sliding droplet.},

abstract = {1-methyl-D-tryptophan (1-D-MT) is currently being used in clinical trials in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors with the aim of inhibiting indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated tumor immune escape. IDO is expressed in tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes and degrades tryptophan (trp) to create an immunsuppressive micromilieu both by depleting trp and by accumulating immunosuppressive metabolites of the kynurenine (kyn) pathway. Here we show that proliferation of alloreactive T-cells cocultured with IDO1-positive human cancer cells paradoxically was inhibited by 1-D-MT. Surprisingly incubation with 1-D-MT increased kyn production of human cancer cells. Cell-free assays revealed that 1-D-MT did not alter IDO1 enzymatic activity. Instead, 1-D-MT induced IDO1 mRNA and protein expression through pathways involving p38 MAPK and JNK signalling. Treatment of cancer patients with 1-D-MT has transcriptional effects that may promote rather than suppress anti-tumor immune escape by increasing IDO1 in the cancer cells. These off-target effects should be carefully analyzed in the ongoing clinical trials with 1-D-MT.},

abstract = {The effect of L-tryptophan on root elongation of lettuce seedlings (Lactuca sativa), as well as on allelochemical activity of three species of root growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), was studied under controlled axenic conditions. L-Tryptophan exhibited an hormonelike effect, promoting root elongation of lettuce seedlings at 10minus5 and 10minus3 mM by ca. 20{\%}, but at 10 mM, root elongation was inhibited by ca. 52{\%} compared to the control (L-tryptophan-free). Comamonas acidovorans 26, Agrobacterium sp., and Alcaligenes piechaudii promoted root elongation of lettuce seedlings by 15, 30, and 44{\%}, respectively. When 10 mM L-tryptophan was applied, Agrobacterium sp. and A. piechaudii inhibited root elongation by 57.6 and 63.5{\%}, respectively. However, at the same concentration of L-tryptophan, C. acidovorans 26 promoted root growth. It is suggested that L-tryptophan reverted root growth promotion through enhancing the secretion of indole-3-acetic acid by the rhizobacteria. L-Tryptophan may have both a direct effect on root growth and an indirect effect through affecting activity of root growth-mediating bacteria. Since the growth of C. acidovorans 26 was exclusively inhibited by L-tryptophan (10 mM), it is conjectured that reduced population of this bacterium could not generate IAA at a level sufficient to inhibit root elongation. Despite the mild root growth promoting effect of C. acidovorans 26, its consistent root growth promotion, perhaps justifies further experimentation.},
